## Abtract
Smartphone applications (apps) designed for Blind and Low Vision (BLV) individuals play a crucial role in supporting their independence and accessibility. In this study, we adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining topic modeling, keyword-based filtering, and thematic analysis to analyze user-written reviews from 27 assistive smartphone apps focused on navigation and object/text recognition. We curated a list of 133 keywords related to visual impairment and eye conditions and extracted 2,163 reviews (out of 12,229 reviews). We analyzed 3,163 reviews (containing the extracted 2,163 reviews and a random 1,000 reviews that did not contain BLV-related keywords). Our findings reveal six major categories of user feedback, including praise and usefulness, general app usage, usability issues, feature requests, bug reports, and privacy concerns. From the 2,163 keyword-matched reviews, we manually annotated and isolated 680 reviews written by or about BLV individuals, revealing references to 20 distinct eye conditions. Our analysis shows that reviews involving BLV individuals appear more frequently in assistive apps than in general-purpose ones. While the overall sentiment of these 680 reviews was positive, BLV-authored reviews contained a higher proportion of critical feedback—particularly regarding us-ability—compared to reviews from non-BLV users, highlighting the need to prioritize their perspectives in app design.
