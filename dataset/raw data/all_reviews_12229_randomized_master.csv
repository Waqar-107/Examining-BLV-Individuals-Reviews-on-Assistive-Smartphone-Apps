Be My Eyes,It’s been a month and I still have not got a call so the app is not worth it,10/23/20 2:00,2
Be My Eyes,Feels great to be able to help others.  Highly recommended as either a person who needs help or a person offering to help others.,03/09/18 15:50,5

OneStep Reader,"This app does with most only promise to do but never deliver.  It is a key tool in my every day work flow.  It is worth the time and effort to learn how it works and how to best use it so that it fits into your daily flow. 

Give it a try, you won’t be sorry and I’m sure you’ll love it as much if not more than I do, if that’s possible.

Be My Eyes,I’ve been a member since 2018 and have answers about 10 calls. The app is super easy to use and I’ve never had a call from someone that I was unable to help.,11/24/22 1:06,5

Be My Eyes,What a wonderful concept for an app. Absolutely amazing and heartwarming.,01/25/20 1:02,5
Be My Eyes,Very nice help people 😁,07/09/18 10:38,5
Be My Eyes,I like the app but it's been 3 months and I still haven't got my first call am I doing something wrong with this app?,01/29/18 10:15,5
TapTapSee,"I took pictures of pretty much everything I could find when I first got this app, and it identified everything. When the novelty wore off, I focused only on food. I'm good at identifying some food items by touch but some items are hard to identify on my own. For instance, I might know I'm picking up a TV dinner, but which one? All my soup bottles feel the same as well. I have frozen veggies and meats in my freezer. With this app, I don't have to get my hands cold feeling inside the bag to see what it is I have in my hand. I only need to reach inside the bag now once I'm sure of what the item is. No longer do I need to wonder if I'm actually opening my can of tomato sauce instead of beans. What's great about this app is that you can submit up to five pictures at once. So if you're not sure where the front of the box is vs. the back, you can take pictures of both sides.  Or you can take  a picture of a can from different angles if you're not sure where the name of the item is on the can. This makes the app very effective. I'm very pleased with this app.",03/18/13 16:47,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing app for both the fully able and those in need of assistance. My first call was more than just helping. Had a wonderful conversation with a stranger on the other side of the world to find out they were raised in the same city as me. Small world!,03/08/19 10:22,5
Be My Eyes,One of the best greatest app ever.,10/06/17 18:18,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the idea of this app, but I've had issues with not being able to hear people after trying to accept the call and also after accepting the call, only being able to speak with them and not see the video. I wish the software could be rewritten or that the app could be written better.",01/27/22 12:15,2

Be My Eyes,got my first call within a day of downloading the app. it’s only been 1.5 months and I’ve had two calls total. Both were great and I actually had the opportunity to chat with the second user for a while after I assisted them and it was very heartwarming for the both of us. would totally recommend for both seeing and visually impaired people. five stars for sure!,12/23/20 4:57,5

The connection has been good and I've been able to help the person on the other end. I love being a small part of such a simple and helpful service.",04/03/24 19:23,5
Be My Eyes,I love having the ability to help! Truly grateful.,04/28/22 17:29,5
Be My Eyes,Be my eyes is an amazing app but there is just one thing that needs to be fixed. When I am on a call to a volunteer VoiceOver keeps telling me I’m either disconnected or connected. Please sort this problem out I am using the iPhone 7 running iOS 14,10/06/21 9:18,3

Be My Eyes,Great idea for an app but I don't get any calls so I may as well uninstall it.,03/06/23 14:37,1
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,Superb app. It must be installed in all phones those are used by blind people,03/27/20 2:37,5
Be My Eyes,"I love how easy it is to help someone. Every time I answer a call, the person on the other line is extremely appreciative.  This app was a great idea! I would, however, like to know more about how the app works for the visually impaired person’s perspective.",01/01/19 19:06,5

Be My Eyes,"I got a call but the screen was completely black, not like the person had their lights off,just that I wasn't seeing anything from their end. and when I tried to give a thumbs down 👎 to report problems, it didn't do anything",05/03/23 8:39,4
Be My Eyes,Great app but the app's icon needs to change. Make the background colour gradiant blue like calm app.,03/07/21 4:00,5
Be My Eyes,"I can tell that the app authors have really worked hard on this app. Very simple and intuitive. I've used it since March 2015, and had about 23 alerts (roughly once every 2 months), and I was able to answer it in time about 6 times. Wonderful experience every time!

So far I helped people with mac-n-cheese directions, TV menu settings, oven temperature, clothing colors, and webpage fine-print. 

I think the only feature request is some configuration on TIME OF DAY. The standard settings only allow you to receive calls between 8am and 9pm (08:00-21:00) in your local time zone, which is fine for me. But I feel it should be a configurable option.

Also, it might be nice for volunteers to list their various skills, and then callers could optionally request skills. E.g. techie, fashion, color recognition, cooking, lengthy request, mathematics, regional info (by city?), or other special interests.",01/11/19 3:09,5
Seeing AI,"You know, I would give this app a five star rating, if only it had support for more languages.

Be My Eyes,"I love the idea of the app and it's really lovely that someone came up with it at all but I've never received a call from anyone needing help and I've had it for just under a year. While I'm glad that there are far more sighted people to help than people who need it, it does mean that I can't give the full 5 stars I want to since I haven't experienced all aspects of the app.",02/20/21 8:25,4
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded this app years ago and have kept it on my phone no matter what. Over those years I have only received maybe 10 calls, most which I was able to answer and aide the person on the other end of the call. Each phone call, no matter how brief or long, has been a delightful “interruption” to my days. Taking a moment out of my time to help someone pick out the right color sweater to match their pants, or set their washer to the right settings, or take their evening stroll with them, helps me reflect on those little things so many of us otherwise take for granted each day. Reminds me to pause and be grateful for the moment. For what we have, and what we don’t have. To just be present. So I just wanted to say thank you to whoever created this app because this is truly something remarkable and beautiful. You’ve helped me see with more than just my eyes, and to share my gift of vision with others. Thank you.",06/05/23 20:15,5

Be My Eyes,"Download this app - and watch how your life changes from small acts of kindness. 

Be My Eyes is designed to have volunteers assist visually impaired individuals with daily tasks - simply by answering a call from someone who is blind or has low vision. The camera is not activated on your end, just for the individual you are assisting. I’ve helped people sort laundry, pick out a tie to match their shirt, read expiration dates, and so many other small tasks that are challenging for the individual I’m working with. If you receive a call and are unable to take it, no need to worry - another volunteer will help that person instead. It’s an amazing feeling to be connected with someone from a different place, even the other side of the country, and be able to positively impact their day.

Be brave, and join this community - being another person’s eyes, even just for a moment, can make a real difference.

Be My Eyes,"I got a call and it worked well, I was able to hear and see what the person needed help with. I did have to reject a call once because I was outside and it was windy. I wanted to know if the call rings multiple people at once, that way the first person who answers gets it. So it doesn't matter if you reject it, or is it one call at a time?

Seeing Assistant Move,"This app seems to have great potential for my usage cases, but right out of the gate I ran into a blockage. I am photo-phobic and require a complete dark mode UI. The app, like most apps these days, espeically those targetted to the partially sighted, will consider the phone's system setting w.r.t. UI color scheme and adapt accordining. No such luck here. I was unable to find any setting or property to toggle a dark mode UI. I'd be happy to find out I'm just jissing the toggle.",08/17/24 14:37,1

Be My Eyes,"I was kinda excited to download this because it shows how modern phones are beyond a gaming asset. I suppose the only negative thing I can say about it is that the number of volunteers is so high I will probably never get a call of my own to handle. It's at 187k/3.2m right now. ...

I never expected a call because it says you may never get a cal but I was so excited when it was around 8:30 est US time and she was so beyond kind!

Notifications come through that someone wishes to connect, if you are not able to answer it will pass to someone else on the app. I’ve only had 2 calls in my first year on the app (I’m UK based, and 1 caller was from the UK wanting help with the settings on his oven, the other from India, wanting me to identify the name of a magazine he had). Happy to help others via this app.",01/20/25 4:54,5
Be My Eyes,"I got this app the first time I seen it come out. I was excited about being able to help.  Before I could really understand the app & what was happening, I had already gotten a call. So, without knowing what to do, I let someone else take the call. Before day 2 & 3 I had gotten 3-4 more calls. I still did not know what I was doing, so I contacted the app techs and asked for help & explained my situation.  After a few minutes he came back to me, and told me I’d get it, and not to worry about it. 
     Well, after that day through the next year plus I never received a call.  So I took the app off. If the app isn’t going to benefit me, or if I’m unable to use the app to help someone else, I don’t need the app to just be taking up space.",10/17/19 20:48,3
Be My Eyes,"I’ve never written a review, but this one has to go up.

I signed up on the app almost two weeks ago where sighted volunteers can assist visually impaired people across the globe in their day to day activities. 

Funny enough, just last night I was wondering that my phone hasn’t beeped till now and I woke up this morning to my first call where I had to identify the colour of the trousers that a lovely sounding visually impaired lady had to wear today. I was excited for my first call and I honestly didn’t want to mess it up for her. The video quality wasn’t too good and I couldn’t tell blue apart from black, so she promptly held up the trousers against the light to help me identify the right colour. It was navy blue :)

It didn’t take a lot of effort or time and I might not have made a much of a difference, but I haven’t felt this good or even helpful to my ecosystem in a long time.

If you also want to contribute to your ecosystem and help someone else’s life get a tad bit easier, I would highly suggest you download the Be My Eyes App. I for sure can’t wait for my next call!",06/18/18 19:07,5

Be My Eyes,"As someone with a vision impairment I have waited all my life for an app like this to come along. I'll be honest before this app came along I held a pesimistic view of people at large because I've experienced trauma and adversity as a child and continuing to this day. So you could imagine how I must have felt to find an app where people are actually quite friendly to you. I don't think I've had an actual bad experience with getting help and if someone couldn't help me they were honest about it. I've a few concerns with this app though. The app runs kind of slowly and it takes a long time to get a volunteer. I'm not sure if it's because of my internet connection or there aren't as many volunteers available. If it's my internet connection well I guess I'll blame it on Comcast, those monopolistic dogs need to go away anyway as they charge way too much for wifi. If it's because there aren't enough volunteers, we should try to market this app so that it works on android so anyone with a smartphone can use it. I'm glad there are more volunteers to blind people. When the ratio of blind people is smaller than the sighted volunteers that means help is more likely to be available, but we should try to make the wait times less. When it comes to specialized help I get help almost instantaniously, but when I try to get help from a volunteer it takes over 3 minutes. Other than that I think the app is fine, let's just try to improve the responsiveness of the app because sometimes my phone lags and freezes. Also it'd be real cool if there was a way to meet potential matches and find love. What better way to look for love than on an app of nice people who actually care enough to help you and understand you as a disabled person. I'd enjoy the idea to find a man to one day be able to say I met my love on an app to help the blind see. These days you can find love in unexpected places.",05/02/19 16:57,4

BlindSquare,"But not any more. Have been using this for the past 4  years. It is good  but is falling behind the competition for example there are free apps that use google maps data to tell you about surrounding POI's like bus stops etc. BS is still using Foursquare data so the POI's can be out of date and inaccurate as they havent been checked or cleaned properly and there are'nt as many POI's available for example I will have to save a bus stop in BS myself whereas other apps have this data already and it is accurate.  
The battery drains much quicker when using BS to other gps apps and the feature  to export all your saved places in a single file that you can email to yourself has been removed. I do not use icloud and do not want to export one single POI at a time. 
I found this feature useful to backup my Saved POIS.There are also free apps that will tell you if a POI or intersection is on your left or right which BS still does not do",10/19/19 5:06,2

One example is it recognized a Ferris wheel it’s said wheel, Ferris wheel, tourist attraction. It also said people waiting for the bus at night.

I’m updating my update tonight. I discovered that this app can describe videos. But the video has to be two minutes or less. The five minute mark is too large for the video. And it can only give you 10 videos per day. But if you delete the app and start over, you can do as many videos as you want. can you please fix that so the videos can be more than five minutes? thank you.",11/01/24 18:22,1

There is no dark mode, and lots of the text is really small and low contrast. Reading white on black is often far easier for visually impaired people such as myself.

Be My Eyes,"I'd advise everyone to read the Be My Eyes Terms of Service and Privacy Policies you agree to by using this service, before actually participating in this service.

In their Terms of Service that basically state that may share the content of video calls you do with third parties, and that while anonymizing some details about that, that they will not edit the video calls at all. So, some unknown company you don't know, that Be My Eyes is using to help with their service, will get to view a video conference you made with a blind or sighted person. I don't want anybody besides this company, using that information. TOS agreements like this and just legal bull crap and give the company way too much freedom with your personal data.

I know most people never read a company's Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. But, if you want to know more about what I stated or doubt the veracity of my claim, read it yourself. It is linked at the bottom of the page in the App Store for this app.

Also, something else that I found really detestable in their Terms of Service. Is that Be My Eyes states clearly that they will give your personal information, your phone number, email address, to charities or other similar organizations. Basically, Be My Eyes hands out or more likely sells your personal information to telemarketers. Wow, how wonderful... Just because it's a so called charity you're giving our personal information to, well that doesn't make it less annoying when they hound you on your cell or home phone, day and night, trying to get you to give money. 

Plus, look up online the track record of charities that use telemarketing to get donations. Haha, it's not a very ethical track record. I don't want those possible charlatans constantly annoying me with incessant phone calls all day, every day. They usually don't take ""I'm not interested, please take me off your list, thank you"" for an answer.

I was all for wanting to helping the blind or visually impaired by using this application/service. But, it's a shame that their Terms of Service are so messed up and way too broad for my peace of mind. And, again, I'd advise anyone interested in using this app and service to first read the company's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that you both agree to by using this app/service. 

I give two stars on the merit of this seemingly good idea. But really I would give only the default one star just going off of the shady policies you have to agree to here. Update those to make them less invasive and shady and I'll be happy to help out with by using this app.",05/17/18 7:40,2

Be My Eyes,I just got my first call after having this app for a month. I got to help someone turn their air on because it was stuck on the heat. He was so grateful & the feeling of being able to help someone with such a small gesture is addictive. I wish I could answer calls all day lol!!,02/15/20 20:46,5
Be My Eyes,"I really love this app. I literally drop everything I’m doing to answer a call…if the phone is not in my hand, or right in front of me, and I’m running to my phone..I miss the call.

Be My Eyes,"Be my eyes is a very useful concept. As one would expect from an app of this nature, it is fully accessible. One complaint I do have, is whenever you make a call, The app makes the iPhone perform some sort of equalization to voiceover. While I'm not a big fan of the iPhone doing that, and I normally wouldn't complain about it, the app doesn't reset whatever sound settings it sets after the call has ended. The only ways that I have found to force the sound to reset itself back to its normal setting, is to either close the app and reopen it, or activate Siri. I'm not sure if this is being caused by iOS, or be my eyes it's self, but I figured I would let people know none the less. The only thing I can say for certain regarding the sound, is that it only happens when you make a call for help.",01/21/15 5:38,4
Envision AI,It's not getting updated in Play Store. what is the other way to update this app on Android phone,06/28/24 20:32,3

Be My Eyes,"I have volunteered for be my eyes for a few years now and have been privileged to answer 5 calls in that time 
To be able to help someone and support them in keeping there independence is fantastic 
There are a lot of volunteers compared to uses I think currently half a million user to 7 million volunteers but that’s great and I always feel lucky that I have got to the call in time 
The services I have helped with are settings on a tv, use by dates on products , what’s in canned food , what colour scarf and the colour of a top 
Simple tasks for non visual challenged people and such great help for the caller 
The app is easy to use and I have had no technical problems when answering the call 
Great service",11/16/23 1:14,5

Be My Eyes,This is such an amazing app and concept and now that I’ve taken my first call and helped someone I’m hooked this is such a great way for visually impaired people to get quick and simple help for any day to day task.  & from a helper POV : I LOVE helping with anything that I can so being able to have this app where someone who needs visual assistance can easily reach out and ask questions and get the help they need is so fascinating .,11/19/21 14:31,5
Be My Eyes,I absolutely love this app.  Download and share your visual gift with others.,01/11/18 3:01,5

Also, the app does very well in helping me know the colors of my clothing. Finally, I love how it is able to identify appliances such as my NeutraBullet blender. I so look forward to applying this app in many aspects of my daily life. Thank you so very much once again!",03/24/17 11:37,5

Product names and some product instructions. Be patient when it comes to their camera adjustment please. She was having problems getting the camera in the right place & almost gave up on the call.Reassured her we're here to help & I had time.Thanks creators & all involved in keeping this app going.

Be My Eyes,"I love this app, when I first registered early in 2017 I had to be patient but eventually got a few calls and was able to offer help to some lovely people. Recently though, had nothing much coming through and have now discovered that I am being logged out of the app on all my devices, so on the rare occasions it does ring, when I go to answer, I’m told I’m logged out. I know the important thing is that people get the assistance they are looking for, but please don’t log people out when they haven’t used the app in a while, there’s so many volunteers (which is great) that we can wait months to be dialled.",09/07/18 6:15,5

TapTapSee,"This app continues to surprise me in the things that it is able to figure out from the images I capture with my camera.when I took a picture of a wood carving, it was able to identify the animals and other items that appear in it.I played designer boardgames and I've had it actually identify cards from those games.so far, I really haven't been able to find anything that it can't identify.",10/28/14 20:27,5
Be My Eyes,"The main complaint I have about this app is that I rarely ever got any 
calls and that is because there are nearly 2 million sighted volunteers and 
roughly 85,000 blind users of the app. There was one time that I received a 
call however I was busy with another task at the moment but of course 
someone else was available and picked up the call. The app works how it is 
supposed to so no other complaints there. It's definitely a helpful 
resource I can imagine :-)",06/30/18 8:33,4

Be My Eyes,"i love this app and am very glad that I've been able to answer some phone calls to help a few people out. 

i have a couple issues, one is that you can't set the ringtone or volume for the calls from the app. the notification for a phone call is not very loud, so it would be nice to have settings for that. 

also my last phone call i was unable to turn on the callers' phone light or take a picture with their phone. so yeah just some fine tuning can be done but otherwise what a positive way to use technology!",08/04/23 3:00,4

Be My Eyes,"I used to help the blind fairly often & really enjoyed doing so...but now there is no way to get the app to open to accept alerts that are defaulting to my Apple Watch.  The call alerts used to be handed off just fine from watch to iPhone on the previous version of Be My Eyes.  I was a ""promising helper"", but no longer can help the blind b/c I can no longer accept calls.  I miss seeing my stats as well.  Why was this taken away?  This was a great idea that no longer works for helpers that have Apple watches.  Many potential helpers excluded now...isn't that defeating your purpose?  Please go back to the old interface, version and functionality that worked just fine.  Another instance of ""Don't fix what is not broken"".  😓",08/05/17 17:12,1

Be My Eyes,"Honestly, I signed up thinking I would help people who needed it, but I wasn't ready for my first call!! I picked up the call and it was nothing like I expected. The guy was super friendly! He just wanted to know if he put the right shirt on. I laughed and read the inappropriate statement on the shirt. He laughed harder and said ""yup, that's the right one"". He thanked me for answering, and went on with his day. It was great. I guess it changed my perspective of what helpful means. :)",06/26/22 18:19,5
Be My Eyes,"Here's an excerpt from their terms you must agree to in order to use the app: 'Be My Eyes reserves the right to make unilateral modifications to these Terms of Service at any time, without your consent, and you agree that we may do so.' That's a huge nope from me. You have got to be joking. In these days of dwindling privacy and safety online, you expect volunteer users to agree to that? Seriously?",11/29/23 11:53,1

Be My Eyes,"This app is such a fantastic concept, and I was really excited to be a part of this exciting work. Unfortunately, shortly after installing this app, my phone started overheating all the time, freezing, locking, and becoming unresponsive to touch. I thought I needed a new phone, but then I remembered I had recently installed a new app. I uninstalled and all of the performance issues with my phone resolved.

Yesterday I helped a visually impaired woman choose the correct colour dress for her day. These are little things most people don’t even think about and it was a privilege to help.

Be My Eyes,"If you are blind or have low vision and don't have this app, get it now! It means never getting stuck anywhere with nobody around where  the one piece of information is a sign, or something, that you have no way of accessing. It is just amazing that so many people have volunteered to be part of this that you can call on them almost anytime and get someone right away. With the tap of one button. I've used them to read error messages on a new computer when the built-in speech would not start, to look over the manual for a new product, to read the menu in a restaurant which was not on-line, while I was waiting for a friend, and to tell what color a little indicator light was. But I can think of so many places this would have been helpful, and it's really nice knowing I won't get stuck again. Like when the bus isn't coming and there's a print sign about it that I can't read, when an office is closed and there is a sign on the door, when I want to grab a bite to eat and it would normally take me a half hour of poking around  on my phone to figure out what's in the neighborhood, I could just call someone and have *them* look around. And so much more. All the little things that can cause so much trouble just don't have to be a problem.  I particularly appreciate being able to work with volunteers to whom I am anonymous and therefore are doing this for their own reasons, maybe just to contribute to the better good, instead of people who kind of expect an ongoing relationship of gratitude. It is much more dignified. Thanks to all the volunteers who do give their time this way.",03/03/19 18:02,5

OneStep Reader,"I've never used this app. The reason why will be obvious in a second. I find it hilarious how they said you'd never have to worry about getting overcharged, because it reads receipts.

Can't actually say if it works or not but that's irrelevant because unless it can read my thoughts too, it's not worth 100.",10/06/19 16:18,2

Lookout - Assisted vision,"When I updated your app yesterday there was a choice to increase or decrease a volume panel. There was also something that said ask a question. That has disappeared. What happened? Any ideas? ••••••• It's good • It can be improved • I suggest adding ""zoom in / zoom out"" for the ""Discovery"" option • At the moment it's picking up too many objects in its sight. • Also: It needs an easy access speed control slider and pitch control slider.",11/09/23 8:04,4
TapTapSee,"I'm a totally blind iPhone user. I was told about this app by a visually impaired friend about 3 years ago. Since then, I've found myself relying on it more and more. When I take pictures to post on Instagram, I use TapTapSee to make sure I captured what I wanted to. I do the same thing when someone goofs up and sends me a picture. I've also used it to identify drinks, medicines and my clothes. It's also fun to take random pictures of objects in my house and see what it comes up with. Keep up the good work!!!",05/29/16 4:56,5
Be My Eyes,"i think this app is great for those who have vision problems and are hearing. however what about deaf people who also have low vision? i think it would be great if there was a way that they could be on this app and be connected to volunteers like me who also know sign language so that they too can get the help they need with tasks such as these. there are several medical conditions that cause both low vision and hearing loss. i don’t think it would take much of a change to the app for this but I’m not an app developer so i don’t know. i have a friend who texts me all the time asking to read phone numbers and such that are too small and I’ve wanted to suggest this app, but while he can speak, he lost his hearing in high school and now relies on sign language for receptive communication. so he continues to rely on friends like me but sometimes i don’t see the text right away. so that’s my take. it’s great but leaves out a large group of low-vision people that could use our help too.",09/01/23 11:20,4

Be My Eyes,"I've had this app on my phone since it was first released and finally got the opportunity to help someone for the first time today. Yes, the calls you will receive as a sighted person are few and far between, BUT that should be a good thing!

BlindSquare,"I’m BLIND. After paying $39.99 to get the app, it appears that a BLIND person has to purchase voice command credits to use voice commands for the BLINDSquare app. I’m emphasizing BLIND because an app for BLIND people should not be free for sighted or low vision people and have extra fees for BLIND people. I want to be wrong about this but it’s impossible for me to get through all the instructions since I can’t read them. Voice over would take forever to get through the instructions, too. What am I missing? Am I correct or incorrect about this? I like the idea of this to help me navigate but I can’t use the app unless I can use my voice.",01/14/23 21:27,1

Be My Eyes,"I received my first call as a volunteer for Be My Eyes yesterday after having the ap installed for several months.

Be My Eyes,"Downloaded the app a year ago. I had previously had two or three failed call attempts (one or two too slow or busy, and another with either connection or user issues). Today I finally had another call and it was successful. It certainly helps to know several languages and indicate it on your profile, that way you're open to more people. And another review mentioned the app needed to be open to receive calls but that's not the case, unless that was changed in an update at some point. Excellent.",08/25/20 15:26,4

TapTapSee,"I use this in the kitchen to distinguish between similar packages and cans.  It will not read the ingredients or directions, but does basic OCR of larger print.

I am so grateful for it being free now!",03/15/17 16:12,5

OneStep Reader,"it's an absolute disgrace that they are asking over a €100 for an app like this. The only reason they can ask this amount is because in some European countries the government might give financial support to people with a visual disability. For the unlucky people who don't get this financial support, spending €100 on an app like this is basically unjustifiable and why would you, if you can't even get a trail to see if it actually works, supports your language and fulfills your expectations...",03/26/25 6:32,1

WeWALK - Smart Map,"The app works more-or-less as intended and gets better with bug fixes, however I do think it's missing the critical feature of waypoint navigation, in the fashion of GoodMaps Outdoors and similar. Google Maps is fine for certain kinds of route but sometimes there's no real substitute for a custom route with meaningful waypoints. If that feature could be added then I think this would be absolutely the one app for use with the cane.",05/19/23 9:19,4

Legitimately like 100 each day since I downloaded the app. I tried to sign up without sharing my email address but could not, and it was specifically mentioned when I was forced to provide my email address that it would not be shared. Clearly a huge lie. Downloaded this app to try and do something nice and am now dealing with all of this spam email. Not happy at all. And it’s probably all for naught because I likely won’t get a call to assist on.",01/20/20 4:09,1

Keep up the great work!",12/22/17 4:45,5
OneStep Reader,"I recently downloaded (AND PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR) this app to use for assistance in reading books. There seem to be so many poorly designed aspects of this app that are making it tedious to use.
1. When I photograph multiple pages and allow them to process, then try to add more images to the existing file, I can only do it one image at a time.
2. The automatic photo feature just does not work, period.
3. Half the time in manual photo mode using the volume buttons fails to work to take the photo, but at random times it does work.
4. If I photograph multiple images and allow them to process, then go straight into listening to them, the reading accuracy is much higher as the app reads directly from the photograph. However, if I close the app or switch files for too long the images convert into PDF-looking files and much of the text becomes gibberish.
5. The incessant refocusing in the camera app is frustrating because I have to try to time when I press the button, or else it takes a blurry photo.
6. Only one voice option.
7. Button symbols are bizarre and difficult to understand, I don't use any other text-to-voice converters so I only have the visual cues.
8. It is difficult to upload a file, I still cannot figure out how.

I've only had this app for four days and have already run into so many issues. Why does this cost $100 if it barely functions? I'm a poor grad student.",11/18/18 11:45,2
Be My Eyes,"Use your eyes for good. Did you know that kindness costs absolutely nothing?

I truly believe everyone should download Be My Eyes. This incredible, free app allows people with sight to assist those who are blind or visually impaired in their everyday lives—helping them identify objects, read labels, or navigate the world with a little extra confidence.

As a volunteer, I’ve had the privilege of answering calls from people who just need a quick pair of eyes—whether it’s choosing the right product at home, reading expiration dates at the store, or simply confirming colors. Each call is just a few minutes, yet the impact lasts so much longer.

Since joining on April 24, I’ve received four calls so far. While I do my best to answer every time, I know that if I can’t pick up, another amazing volunteer will. It’s a beautiful reminder of how small acts of kindness can create a ripple effect of support and connection.

I can only imagine how valuable this app is for those who rely on it, but I know how rewarding it feels to be able to help. Huge applause to the creators of Be My Eyes—this app is changing lives, one call at a time.

Most calls take less than five minutes. That’s all it takes to make someone’s day a little easier. So why not use your eyes to help someone see? 

Download Be My Eyes today—you never know whose life you might brighten.",02/10/25 18:40,5

Lol I was able to assist someone who needed help figuring out which settings their washing machine was on, and they were so sweet during the call. We chatted for a moment after I’d helped them and said our goodbyes, and the smile hasn’t left my face since. This really made my night, and I’m so happy I was able to help someone!

It might be useful to see call stats so that people can understand the frequency (or lack there of)of calls, and understand what may be a normal “wait” period .",01/31/20 14:47,4

Be My Eyes,"This app is a really great idea and I don’t doubt at all that its helped a lot of people. Probably needs more promotion in blind spaces since theres not many visually impaired people on it, but still helpful to those who are. Unfortunately there seems to be a lot of creeps on it. The one call I’ve gotten was a man who could very obviously see fine and was just being a pervert. Sorting reviews by most critical shows this is not a rare experience either.",12/08/24 3:25,3
TapTapSee,"I have a blind friend who is in love with this app, it helps her find things she can't locate.

Be My Eyes,I’ve been blind for five years now and I’ve been using this app for little over two years. I’ve had nothing but great experiences. Met some great people from all over the world.

Now I’m using it all of the time to get Covid test results. here’s a new way that one of my students just used Be My Eyes: he used it to review all of his recordings that were in the list for DVR. He was able to delete them. It is a super helpful app and again, and affirmation of the world community. We all need that, especially now. Thank you! I absolutely love this app. I use it several times a week. I could not have gotten along without it during the pandemic, especially. It is an affirmation of the world community!

Be My Eyes,"The only reason this app is effective as it is is that the number of volunteers SIGNIFICANTLY outnumber those who are blind or low sighted. I've only answered a couple of calls and I've been on this app for around a year. Even if you have an open schedule you won't be constantly bombarded with calls, as I actually will leave class just to answer one.

Be My Eyes,"I got a call, several months, after downloading the app.

She had an old fashioned thermometer and couldn’t read it. Those are awful to read in person, I couldn’t help (feel awful about it).  I couldn’t see it well enough to read. 😔 But, the system worked just the way it was supposed to - connected a visually impaired person with someone sighted.

If you can’t answer that’s okay there’s 1,000s of other people that will be called in line after you until call is picked up. You can even turn the other phones light on so YOU can see what person is asking about. Very kind people. Could be a quick 1 minuet what color is this to a long heartfelt conversation. I love this app and it’s members. Hands down 🔟 out of 🔟",04/22/20 10:31,5
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded this app about 2 years ago. I did it the first second I learned of it. I jumped at the chance to answer a call every time I saw my phone ringing, but I was never quite quick enough! Which goes to show you how many great Americans are out there who want to help just as much as I do! Finally though it happened... My phone rang and I clicked to answer and I actually started to be connected with the caller! She wanted something as simple as me telling her which bag of candy was which because she had about 5 bags of miniature candy. That was it. The overwhelming joy that my heart felt to be able to help someone who’s incapable of doing such small tasks such as that, overjoys  me. After the call I just was stuck sitting there for a moment with a smile on my face, and almost sad that I couldn’t help her with more. I hope others can join this app too and have the chance to answer a call to feel the happiness I felt. God bless whomever came up with this app and I hope to be able to continue to help those who cannot help themselves.",01/30/21 9:58,5

Be My Eyes,I like this app and have taken a couple calls. The one complaint I would have is when it rings on my end I have missed calls. I just had one come through as I was reading something on my phone. It took me a second to register what it was. I grabbed the TV remote to mute and just as I muted the TV ended. I’m guessing it switched over to another person?,11/27/22 13:45,5

Envision AI,"The app was better when it was paid, as there were no limitations or slow scanning for important supported languages, but now there is a reading limit to the pages scanned (1000 page per month)  and slow processing .
I contacted the support team via e-mail and I did not find a solution to these problems yet. The answer i got is the reading limit is  set to make sure our servers don't overload depending on the language selected.
Your answer proves that there are a large number of users who benefit from your application, and this limit you have made the application not as useful as before.  
Why don't you increase the number of servers or improve their performance?
Why didn't you think about this step before you decided to make the app free?  And what is the fault of the people who paid to benefit from the application and now they suffer from these limits in using it? 
Please, please Remove the annoying reading limit because it doesn't make sense and makes the app useless for many people.",12/14/22 0:41,3

With this app, you can. I wish there was seriously a 10 star rating, because I would totally give this app a 10 star rating. I mean come on, they make you pay 4 bucks on up  a month? That's less than they should make you pay for it, for all the things that it does!  People want to complain that you need to  pay for the app? It's stupid! I mean, come on! These wonderful people put so much time into this app, if people want to complain just because they have to subscribe to the app, and they have to pay a lousy $4 or up!  That's nothing! I just love this app so much, that I couldn't bear just pay $10, and have to pay $10 again after the end of the month. So, I did the next best thing! I paid for three months. Because, I get so much use out of this app, I felt like paying for three months, and getting Not only  my moneys worth, but my pictures worth, Since they are unlimited pictures!  TapTapSee, you guys are the best, as far as describing pictures, and making the results come fast! I can't give you guys enough gratitude!

Envision AI,this app has helped me gained my Independence. i dont need to ask someone to read things for me. thank you for making an AMAZING app that helps blind people.,02/22/19 17:06,5
Be My Eyes,"Feedback doesn't work. Had my first call helping someone; the video quality was too blurry for me to help, so I tried voting Thumbs Down at the end of the call for feedback but nothing happens. However, the Thumbs Up button was working. After the call, I went into Settings then tried pressing ""Send us feedback"", but that didn't work either. How do you expect to improve when you're not willing to receive negative feedback? For such a simple app, there's no excuse to not have its features tested.",06/09/22 8:49,2
Be My Eyes,So grateful to be able to support other this way!,11/15/22 4:44,5
Be My Eyes,There is something to be said for an app that genuinely makes you feel good. Thank you for making my night with one simple call from someone needing assistance.,12/31/17 1:46,5
Be My Eyes,I got my first call today. Unfortunately what he was looking at was a schematic that I didn’t understand. I hope he was able to find someone who could help him. He was very kind and thanked me for trying to help. Wonderful App!!,07/09/20 1:47,5
Be My Eyes,"My dad, who was blind most of my life, passed away just a few days after I downloaded this app. He used to ask us all the time to be his eyes; I wish this had been around years ago, when we had all just moved out & he was still healthy enough to do things, back when it would have been really useful to him. I wish he was still here to be able to use it. Thank you, so so much, to the developers of this app for letting me be the eyes of others. ❤️",12/18/22 16:58,5
Be My Eyes,"Hi, I am a Kurd from Erbil, I want to be a member of this group of you",06/20/22 9:20,5
Be My Eyes,I am a little skeptical about the app. I think it's a wonderful concept to get volunteers to help but if the person is blind how do they use an iPhone or app on the first place?,02/04/15 15:24,3
TapTapSee,It works ok but it doesn't work with TalkBack. Actually I think there is a problem with TalkBack has it causes my phone to freeze up when I enabled it.,10/09/14 9:44,4

Be My Eyes,"Apart from bragging right of altruism, this app might enable me to help someone far away, but why not start with our neighbor, or the closest person we have, i believe that is more fulfilling relationship...",02/14/23 8:47,1
Envision AI,"This app is fantastic!
I just got my dads hospital discharge letter which was folded up in my pocket, unfolded it and scanned it while holding the letter roughly in my hand. The app quickly scanned and analyses the letter that was full of technical information and in a table format. The app reformatted the document and presented it as reformatted plain text on the screen and got it 100% correct and totally readable. I tried the same with seeing AI and KNFB reader and they didn’t know what the duck they were looking at I even spread the white document out on the floor which is dark and neither seeing AI or KNFB reader had a clue!! The only issue is that this app tells me that it’s the 14 day evaluation copy which means at some point you must have to pay for it and I can’t find anywhere where they say how much it costs!",12/24/19 6:18,5
NaviLens,"This seems clever, but it's not. The barcode contains no information - it's just a reference to a database. Companies pay to have their information in there. There are plenty of free barcode standards that can encode information in the code itself. There have been numerous attempts to monetise 2D barcodes and this is yet another. QR codes are free and can hold up to 4K of info with no need for a monetised database or online access. This will be dead within a few years.",09/19/24 13:31,2
Be My Eyes,"This is a great way to lend your abilities to others who are visually challenged.

Just a great idea and a perfect presented app. Credit to the developers!",11/15/23 12:28,5

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded the app 2 days ago, and the very next day I received a call. I was able to help someone from my pantry while my son was at school. How amazing it is to be able to help someone across the States from my house in my time off? Such an amazing idea and concept.",09/05/18 23:34,5
Be My Eyes,I have had this app for a while now. And the difference and changes you can make in somebody's day. Small things we don't think about. Such as dressing in a color that you're significant other prefers.,12/14/22 14:30,5

Be My Eyes,Great experience helping visually impaired people.,09/15/22 2:25,5
Digit-Eyes,"Great app, actually does what it says on the box. I find it particularly useful for reading manufacturer's barcodes to identify products that aren't distinctly packaged. Once you get the nack of scanning the barcodes and a feel for where they are generally located on the packaging (see www.digit-eyes), it becomes easier and easier. If you can't see well enough to read, invest some money in this app and some time in learning to use it for worthwhile results.Please note that scanning takes some practise, so when you start off, remember that the app actually works and its just a learning curve.More manufacturerer info when reading barcodes and fixing a bug which causes the app to exit after a second scan would get 5 stars from me.",06/28/10 22:02,4
Cash Reader for the Blind,Works great. Very easy to identify currency bills.,01/07/19 4:06,5

Be My Eyes,"I was using this app to try and find my shoe. I tried connecting with someone who was no help, especially when a young woman ran up to me and stole my shoe!! She took it and RAN so I had to follow her using solely my ears. I tripped because this person didn’t warn me of a bush!! I was so hurt I started to cry. Then they must have reported me because I was banned! 1 out of 5 stars.",05/21/18 18:01,1

Be My Eyes,"I won’t be the first and definitely the last to say this app with its new my AI feature is mind blowing. Sighted people unconsciously tell you what they think you need to know, and they are themselves often surprised by things My AI includes in the description of a picture that they are not aware of themselves. Apart from this, the volunteers remain as helpful as always.
This is definitely an app anyone with a visual impairment just cannot afford to be without! Look out human and paid services! :-)",09/16/23 2:43,5

Be My Eyes,"I was explaining something to a user and due to time limit the call got disconnected 
Otherwise its a 10 starr app",07/21/24 19:52,5
Be My Eyes,"One suggestion I have would be the ability to leave a short message at the 
conclusion of a call. My first call ended abruptly when I momentarily lost 
my network connection. I would have liked the opportunity to apologize to 
my partner on the other end! Also, my mother has used this app as a blind 
person, and would like to send a note of thanks to those who help her.",06/05/18 13:12,5
Be My Eyes,"The idea is amazing. However changes need to be made so it doesn't become just another forgotten app. I have been a member for over a month and nothing, so either blind people aren't using it or the filter are not well planned out. There should be a way of putting more than one language which would help increasing chances of getting calls for those who speak more than one language. I strongly believe in the whole idea for this app but changes and maybe a better publicity for it in the blind community should be made so that it can truly bring a great experience to all it's users",12/09/18 5:12,4
Envision AI,I have tried this app to read all regional languages it work awesome,09/26/22 5:58,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This app was recommended to me by my mobility trainer after a really scary intersection, crossing in the middle of a big city with a crosswalk that did not make any sound when it was time to cross. I love having this when I have to cross intersections that are not disability friendly. My only complaint is that different lighting situations are not reliable, and if there are more than a few lanes, the app sometimes just continuously says it’s not safe to Cross? instead of simply telling me that it’s not workin",05/10/24 19:00,4

Lookout - Assisted vision,App works OK. But I understand that its in beta testing. So with that said I will be able to get you what needs to be fixed . First off I'm blind in one eye and can't barely see our of the other. So far something that the app has gotten right but if you don't want something to happen you need this app to really have it diff between a wall and the floor and mirror and steps. And whare I have pets it would be nice for it to let me know that there is a mess in the floor so I don't step in it lol .,08/27/22 18:55,4

Be My Eyes,"I love being able to help someone day or night 24/7. There is many people who are willing to answer the call whenever you need help. I just have one wish that the assistant could have settings where we can make our calls louder and call whenever we want not just where we live, instead of the original of what comes with the app. I am half deaf so I can barely hear when someone calls, but I have my volume up the highest it can go, and I have my settings on the loudest it can do on my part on my phone. I wish the app would fix or put in settings where you can choose a louder sound for calls. I would love to help more people if the app can put better features that can happen so I can get to my phone faster. Lol I just love helping people!  But other than that I am very happy to be able to help the visually impaired and I hope more visually impaired people will use this app for help there are so many volunteers there is always someone there 24/7 to help you in any country!",10/23/20 1:16,5

BlindSquare,"I have had this app a few years and I use it exclusively for bus travel. Don’t need it for trains, only if the stop announcement automation is not working then I will employ blind Square. It is fantastic on buses because it opens up an  horizon of information I’ve never had access to before. Even on very Familia roots. It gives you everything from pubs, restaurants to businesses. It reads out every junction which it  never  did before which is very helpful when judging my bus stop distance However, I hear references to searching bus stops as a landmark and I don’t know how to do that. Any help would be appreciated. i’ve never used it for walking a route maybe I will try that. I also do not understand the simulation function I’ve tried it and all I get is extraneous traffic noise please explain what the benefit of this is?",05/09/18 0:49,5

Be My Eyes,"This is such a great resource. I work as a behavior analyst for a company that provides group homes for adults with developmental disabilities. It is a constant struggle to identify reliable community resources for people who need them, and it can be very stigmatizing to constantly rely on family and friends for help. Sharing this responsibility across so many enthusiastic users is just beautiful. It’s how natural supports were meant to work.

TapTapSee,I used CamFind before I found this app. I didn't like the product search on CamFind so this app is better. What i hate about TapTapSee is the huge number of permissions and that it requires Talkback. CamFind spoke aloud just fine without talkback. Why does TapTapSee need it?,11/27/16 0:20,3
Be My Eyes,"The app works well and it feels so good to be able to provide help when someone needs it, without any of the awkwardness which would often accompany such a request.  Thank you for creating such a useful and thoughtful app.",04/20/19 14:21,5

I felt so bad I couldn't help.",03/30/20 6:45,2

Be My Eyes,"I have gotten help from Be My Eyes in countless tasks, but I think they help I am most grateful for right now is the specialized help from Microsoft that is offered through Be My Eyes. They have helped me solve so many computer problems that calls to the regular Microsoft answer desk have not solved or have actually made worse. I also appreciate the every day tasks that be my ice helps me to accomplish, such as making sure my oven is set correctly, knowing colors of clothes, and helping me with printed documents. I am so grateful for this app. Thank you for a wonderful service. And thank you to all the volunteers!",08/02/19 21:28,5
Be My Eyes,"At first I didn’t get any calls. I thought it was a good idea but I didn’t get to try it so that kinda bummed me out. 
Today I got my first call! It was absolutely amazing. I simply chose an outfit for the kind man. However, it made really happy. It made my day!
Also, the connection was flawless and I also generally like the design of the app! 
This should be the future! It is revolutionary!!!",11/26/19 15:57,5
Be My Eyes,great app. nice to help others.,03/08/19 8:11,5
Be My Eyes,"I got a call a couple days ago . It felt nice to help someone out . 
Great app",12/17/21 14:14,5
Be My Eyes,it seems like an amazing app but I always get an unexpected error on it so I can't even log on to it,07/24/19 8:14,1
Seeing AI,"I really hate to admit that Microsoft has designed such a wonderful app. Well done! ...despite the glitches It wouldn’t be Microsoft without the glitches, though!",12/04/19 3:25,4

Be My Eyes,I have not used this application yet. But just downloaded this and am thankful for products like this to exist since becoming partially blind.,07/17/22 0:34,5
Be My Eyes,It such a simple thing to do answer the phone and give a couple of minutesof your time,08/24/18 15:32,5
Be My Eyes,Signed up to help around 2 years ago. Have received around 7 calls. 2 of which I did not get to in time. Great experience thus far. Hardest was assisting someone to find an email on their computer. The audio was great but the video quality made it very difficult to read their device screen. The number of volunteers far outweigh the number of clients. But it is a thrill to get the alert and have the opportunity to assist.,05/23/22 11:47,4
Be My Eyes,This app is incredible… I have assisted many people with different tasks. It always feels good to be able to help someone and this app allows so many people to do just that.,05/03/22 23:54,5
Be My Eyes,I volunteer about once every couple of months and it’s always great helping people especially those that speak my native language,10/22/24 0:08,5
Be My Eyes,"This app and the service it provides is amazing.  I only get to answer a call about once a year due the odds.  There are several million helpers while there are only 350,000 blind subscribers.  So, that leaves very few chances you’ll be able to answer a call.",12/26/21 20:12,5
Envision AI,It is not working ..... or just a dummy.....😯,02/09/20 2:09,1
Lookout - Assisted vision,Not a bad app just does not replace any Google,01/13/24 14:19,2
Be My Eyes,"I've gotten a few calls, and each time it didn't work. It kept buffering, saying, ""Trying to answer your call.""",01/10/22 11:35,2
Be My Eyes,"Thank you for priceless opportunity to be someone's eyes. The video call went well. I will learn more languages in order to be able to help more people. Best regards, Jum.",05/03/19 7:44,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the app, but I wish there was a feature that prevented a accidental diaconnect.",12/22/17 13:21,5

TapTapSee,Whose idea was it to just copy the description over from iOS. There is a huge difference between iOS voice over and talk back. Could it not have killed you to write a custom description for Android users? Talk back is not voice over.,04/04/14 16:42,5
Be My Eyes,"I just realized the fact, I have talk to them in order to help them.......I cant text :""(",08/20/20 8:34,4
Be My Eyes,"A brilliant, simple idea, tech at its most useful. I'm totally blind with friends and family but even so I feel an increased sense of independence with the app. It is potentially even more useful for a blind person on their own. I've had help to sort food packages, tins, get my tele started. I'm constantly pushing my sighted friends to sign and I'm winning. For any potential volunteer, you can't overestimate the importance of the time you are giving, a minute from you and you can free a log jam.",03/24/19 23:56,5
Envision AI,My subscription till 26dec2021but it shows 26dec2019 pls resolve this problem,01/28/21 8:10,3

OneStep Reader,"This is the app I have been waiting for for the past five years. And it has not disappointed. I have used the previous K NFB reader mobile device and this app for iPhone is much easier to use. It is intuitive. It takes pictures and reads the print   from round spice bottles, small round medicine files, on the back of plastic pouches, in glass picture frames, off of my laptop computer screen. I have many scanner apps on my iPhone and none of them are accurate. But this one is accurate, at least 98% of the time.  Love it. Love it. Love it.",09/20/14 20:10,5
Be My Eyes,"I am not blind, but well very bad eyesight far below the min 10. With glasses I can see 80% -. Without glasses I can hardly see anything only 10/20%. A few times that glasses were lost or could not be found. This app and volunteers are both a great outcome. So thankful. With my glasses I also helping others with eye problems",04/17/22 0:20,5
Be My Eyes,"This app proves to be helpful for some situations! However, I uninstalled it due to safety concerns. There is no confirmation before connecting to a helper, making it too easy to accidentally connect. That makes me feel really uncomfortable, so I'll stick with Using VizWiz.",01/30/15 22:56,2
Be My Eyes,Sooper app,12/13/23 22:02,5
Be My Eyes,The concept it’s amazing you help when they need it the most at the convenience of a phone call,05/21/22 16:52,5
Be My Eyes,I absolutely love this app. Someone I’m following on social media with a very strong following introduced me to Be My Eyes. I love being able to help visually impaired individuals even if it’s with the smallest thing. It makes me feel like I’m doing my part and doing some good in this ever changing world. Any time my notifications go off for a call I only hope that I move quick enough to be the one to answer. I also always send and share the app with friends and family members after each call. Highly recommend every iPhone/Apple user download this app to their device.,05/11/23 2:56,5
Be My Eyes,This is an amazing application. It helps the blind people and makes their work easier. You help people in need just by answering some of their questions on a video call. You are helping humanity by this gesture of kindness. It's a nice app and has good features.,09/14/20 2:21,4
TapTapSee,"Terrific app. I can now tell the can of corn from the can of beans and my red shirt from my blue shirt. Easy to use and surprisingly accurate, although it has trouble identifying some colors. Makes life a lot easier.",02/19/13 6:28,5
Be My Eyes,I have had the pleasure of helping 3 people in the past two years. It has been so rewarding to me. I wish I could do more!,08/03/24 5:20,5

Be My Eyes,"This is by far the most brilliant app to be released in the existence of 
mobile apps. The developer and team deserves a noble peace prize.",07/20/18 16:14,5
Be My Eyes,"I get a call maybe once every 3-4 months.  It’s not an imposition at all!  And every time I’m able to answer I’ve been able to help someone by doing something for them which I have taken for granted.
I’ve read prescription labels, identified the sender of a package, helped someone use an unfamiliar microwave to make dinner, helped someone put together an Easter outfit for visiting her grandchildren, and described a t-shirt which had just come in the mail.
Every single time, I feel fantastic afterward.   I can not recommend Be My Eyes enough",09/04/24 5:02,5

Seeing AI,I am a person with a visual impairment and sometimes struggle to see faces or read text. I tried the “person” feature on my parents and it was pretty close in age and facial expression. Highly recommend this app to any people with a visual impairment!!!,06/08/20 13:53,5
Be My Eyes,"I installed the app and I kid you not, got a call the next day. It felt so good helping someone out. It was a short call, they needed microwave instructions for heating up a ready meal. Hope it worked out fine for the other person. Can’t wait to help out more.",10/07/18 9:18,5

Be My Eyes,Idk if it’s good yet bc I’m downloading it rn qnd Troye recommends it so it must be good.

Be My Eyes,"If I could give this no stars I would. I loved the concept and was ready to start helping people, but I've had this app for awhile now I haven't gotten one call. I started to read the policy and notice this a s heme to access your phone information and send to other people. I'm going to keep for little while longer to see if I get a call, but if I don't I'm deleting it.",02/23/15 14:42,1

Be My Eyes,"good idea in theory but after receiving 0 calls after 3 months it's time to free uo space and this app sees 0 use so it has to good. i believe rhe user base for rhe blind is way too small, and the user base of people willing to help is way too high",08/11/19 12:52,3
Be My Eyes,"I'm not a huge reviewer but I just downloaded this and almost five minutes later got my call. It was fast and easy to connect, had no technical issues, and I feel like I actually helped someone. 

Honestly, I am thrilled by this app. I love the idea of helping someone out - even if it's as simple as reading a yarn label or helping pick out a shirt. It's people helping people, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

I do wish there was a way to review people who volunteer to be their eyes, though. I am worried that this technology could be used by bully or trolls to mislead people. I choose to believe that there are more good people than bad though and look forward to my next call. :)",06/23/17 20:13,5

Be My Eyes,"I signed up to volunteer with Be My Eyes today and received my first call within 10mins of finishing registration.  It was an older dude checking his blood pressure and he asked me to read off the monitor’s numbers, & it was super easy to help him out.  Even though I had to request that he move the phone a bit so I was able to clearly see the bp monitor screen, the app’s video call quality was good enough to communicate without any lagging or issues whatsoever.

One thing I was worried about while registering was the fact that I am actually quite hard of hearing, but my fears were completely unfounded!  This app synchronized perfectly with my iPhone’s subtitles feature and I congratulate Be My Eyes on enabling the deaf to lead the blind!  5 stars for sure!!!",09/29/22 5:16,5

My husband is a computer scientist and engineer is also totally blind, be my eyes increases his independence and when he is cooking be my eyes is as important to the meal as the ingredients or utensils that he is using.  As a counselor specializing in issues of  blindness I’ve installed be my eyes in literally 100s of devices for my clients to use",02/01/18 21:41,5

Be My Eyes,"Hi. So here is the deal. I have had this app for about 2 days now and I have not gotten any calls. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love the idea behind it. And it still astonishes me that someone came up with this. And I know that people are being helped because every time I open the app it says more people have been helped. Please let me know if I have to do something in the settings or something. Any answers will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you,
Nick magnani",01/21/15 2:23,5

Envision AI,Not working at the best till now,06/07/22 7:33,1
Be My Eyes,"I am visually impaired and I use this app almost every day to help me match clothes, read screens and so much more. This app has made my life so much easier because I live in a house by myself with my guy dogs but sometimes I just need a little help adjusting my thermostat or finding the right pair of work clothes in the morning. I definitely would recommend this app to any blind user or even any cited user to be a volunteer.",02/14/21 19:18,5

Can't wait to help someone. ☺️",06/11/18 16:23,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing, I have now gotten three phone calls since downloading and after every call I always feel so happy that I was able to help someone even if it is for the smallest thing! 10/10 recommend this app! One thing I will say is that they are a lot of users on this app, so you just need to be patient when waiting for a call, it may seem like forever but once you get a call to help it’s 100 percent worth the wait!",04/23/22 22:51,5
OneStep Reader,When I first bought this app it was one of the best reading document apps out there. But now it has gone down drastically. So many software updates on here and changing the user face of the platform. I remember when this app was called KNFB reader now it’s called something else they didn’t change the name about 23 times. And now I can barely use it. If I can get my money back I would.,03/03/22 11:36,1

Be My Eyes,"I am a university student and try to help charities as much as I can, however I am on a tight budget and often feel that I cannot contribute financially or even contribute my time to help at charity events as much as I would like to. The Be My Eyes app has allowed me to feel as though I am contributing in a way that is completely free and easy to do! Amazing concept, really recommend to get it for anyone who feels they would like to contribute their help in some way.",10/30/18 10:28,5
Be My Eyes,I answered my first call today and it was so fun to help out somebody in need. The video feed was fantastic too.,09/23/20 22:21,5
Be My Eyes,"Recent issues have affected this app. Although I do get an opportunity to answer a call, theapp logo just spins and it tells me it's attempting to answer the call but never does.. This needs to be corrected ASAP",11/28/21 20:29,3
Be My Eyes,It's beautiful to share humanity and love across the world especially in this War age we are living in.. I'm excited to receive my first call,10/21/18 23:14,5
Be My Eyes,"Wonderful app. I have only received one call because there are so many volunteers. But that's a good thing, so many people willing to take a few minutes out of their day to help a stranger. There is still a lot of good in this world :)",10/10/18 10:03,5
Be My Eyes,"Great app! I love it and it makes me feel like I’m making a better version of myself. I also love helping others who are in need of my help. The Lord gives us the power and wisdom to help others, so why not use this app?",06/04/24 17:46,5
Be My Eyes,Wow! I love how we have found a way to assist people in the basic right of accessibility. This app is SO easy to use. If you can’t take the call because you are busy someone else will; and everyone I’ve encountered has been so nice.,02/19/22 4:15,5

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,I usually travel by public transport either train or grab. And I love to hear lazarillo's announcement along the journey. giving me full description of what's around. Amazing! Those days before lazarillo long journey were very boring.,08/04/23 8:22,5
Be My Eyes,While I’ve only been called on once so far it reaffirmed the need for something like this. A man called and needed help figuring out what cash he had in his pocket (found in previously worn pants) and didn’t have anyone to help him out. I helped identify each bill so he could properly place them in his wallet. It took me all of 30 seconds but that man left his house confident he had enough on hand to get through his day.,03/18/24 3:57,5
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for many years and have missed two calls before finally being available to answer my third. It was a great experience, unfortunately due to internet issues the screen was very blurry. I tried to report this in feedback after the call but none of the feedback avenues within the app seem to be working. I would still highly recommend downloading!",05/06/21 19:08,4
Be My Eyes,Haven't used it yet but I believe they're good,04/26/20 15:55,5

Be My Eyes,"If you haven't volunteered, you should.",05/26/21 16:47,5
Be My Eyes,"I never was called to help a blind person. What I did get is an endless supply of junk mail in my inbox, they must have sold my email address because I never give it out....I thought this was a worthy cause.  I feel I got scammed.",07/09/16 10:47,1
Be My Eyes,Whoever thought of this app is an absolute genius! I love the fact that i can help a visually impaired person whenever they need it right from home or wherever i am. This is amazing and extremely humbling!,02/22/19 1:27,5
Be My Eyes,This app is a cool concept but somehow this app obtained personal information - native language from my device without my permission or input,06/12/18 4:07,1
Be My Eyes,Got my first call today and it would not let me accept the call after 10 times trying to accept but it did let me decline ... Needs to be fixed asap how can I help when I can answer. 11/13/21,11/13/21 7:21,1
Be My Eyes,Can't say but love the idea,10/19/18 13:41,5
Be My Eyes,So wholesome,07/04/19 9:15,5
Be My Eyes,"Downloaded the app 2 weeks ago and I haven't gotten a call. I love the purpose of the app but it needs to let people know what step to take next to get a call and if they are even in a setting where they can receive a call at all. Does the app need to be open or just downloaded to get a call? Do I have to have done all the prompts (watch the video, create profile etc because I've done those already).

This app is so BASIC, which is awesome but leads me to wonder why the hell the kinks haven't been worked out!

Frickin frustrating.",01/26/15 3:26,1
Be My Eyes,It would be great to be able to set availability schedule. I.e. not in the middle.of the night :),06/27/21 7:26,4

Be My Eyes,This app is great! :-) I am able to run my recording equipment without any sided help!,06/27/24 1:04,5
Be My Eyes,"Brilliant, the concept of this is amazing. To be able to help others in need really makes me feel good. I'd love to think if I needed help someone would be there for me. It works just the same as face time, with its own ringtone so you know its the app that is calling. I urge anyone to download this app and pay it forward.",10/26/22 3:38,5

I was a bit worried at first if there was going to be people taking advantage of the video call feature to show inappropriate imagery, but Be My Eyes does a absolutely phenomenal job in making sure that doesn’t happen.

Seeing Eye GPS,"Highly disappointed  I did not mind the cost but expected a lot more from Sendero.  I completed several POI why searches for businesses close to my house and got no results.  This was done using each of the route options for GPS.  I completed a POI search for a specific grocery store close to my house and the directions were inaccurate. It stated the business was on the right when in actuality it was on the left.  If nothing else at least make it accurate.  Also, when completing  a POI  while search it is very slow compared to other applications such as MapQuest. For a totally blind user the app was very easy to navigate. At this point I will continue to use MapQuest And would not recommend this app until the accuracy is fixed.
 
For those that are complaining about the cost look at the cost of the previous mapping programs from Sonero And the cost of the device to run them.",07/13/13 5:37,1

Lookout - Assisted vision,Could use a little tweaking and fine tuning but overall a pretty good app I recommend giving it a try,02/07/24 21:30,5
Be My Eyes,"I got my first call today!  Now I can’t wait for the next one!  It took 5 days for my first call, hope I don’t have to wait another 5 days. The call was super easy and I felt totally secure that they couldn’t see or locate me. It felt so great to tell the man on the other side what the box was he was holding. That was it!  10 seconds and my day was made!  Love this app!",06/20/18 21:57,5

Be My Eyes,Thank you for creating such an amazing app,06/26/18 17:00,5
Be My Eyes,It's a great idea initiative. I'm getting spam calls people asking me about if i get paid to assist blind people on this app so disappointing 😞 😔 so stupid it's even clearly mentioned in the selection that be a volunteer,08/22/23 23:06,5
TapTapSee,I don't really leave reviews but this app is truly something I've never experienced. This is putting technology to good use.,06/19/15 19:55,5
Be My Eyes,Great global community involvement,07/21/18 15:17,5
Be My Eyes,This app helps pepole that are blind good work pepole,01/14/22 13:28,5
Envision AI,Envision is a very good app. It really helped me to read as a visually impaired. Most specially my lecture notes,03/31/23 18:30,5
Be My Eyes,"I was skeptical about this app. I installed it yesterday and received my first call this morning. It went very smoothly and the lady I spoke to needed fashion help. ""Which looks better..."" She was very appreciative and said Thank you several times. Great app!",12/04/18 8:17,5
Be My Eyes,Finally an app to share and help someone... great idea.,05/25/18 8:11,5
Cash Reader for the Blind,App does not read all bills nor asist the blind users adequately it also has no uninstall feature  should be not allowed until fully developed,04/08/19 18:37,1
Be My Eyes,"1st . As a volunteer  I can’t set my availability time and like today I did receive a call but I was at work and didn’t have a chance to answer and now just thinking about is that person found someone to get help ?
2nd . As a volunteer, I hope we can have an score board and a donation part for help projects whom working for helping blind people to we can show others and explain them how it’s work and how we did well and if they want can be a volunteer or do the donation for helping others",07/17/18 17:56,5
Envision AI,Very nice app for my son,10/20/22 17:39,5
TapTapSee,This is a revolutionary app for the iPhone for blind and visually impaired. I'm amazed at how fast it is at identifying objects. This will be useful just about anywhere!,01/26/13 14:10,5
Be My Eyes,I never seem to be able to answer a call. I get an notification one second then the next second it says it was sent to someone to answer.,07/27/22 17:52,3
Be My Eyes,I enjoy it soo much and I think it is very helpful to the visually impaired however I don’t get calls very often at all so it is something that seems to be slightly inactive. But other than that it is a great app and I love reading people’s stories and of course helping others.,08/13/19 6:37,4
OneStep Reader,Great app but this app is broken. I can't open it from my Android phone. I've been waiting for the developers to fix this issue for months but no one is concerned about Android compatibility.,10/31/19 9:52,1
Be My Eyes,I was really happy to help a blind,04/01/23 8:03,5
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,I'm a sighted person who has been trying this app out because I'm helping a lady who has recently become blind. In general it seems excellent but it can seemingly forget the tracked destination sometimes; this has happened when on a bus journey of several miles I've set it to track the destination bus stop - after a few miles it stops giving updates on the distance to the tracked destination.,09/21/21 11:50,4
Be My Eyes,I live getting these calls.,05/30/23 2:56,5
Be My Eyes,The app works really well and is a good way to help people. I've only ever gotten one call but that's very understandable as according to the count in the app there are 3 million volunteers and only around two hundred thousand blind people using it so it makes sense that calls would be rare,06/14/20 17:00,5
Seeing AI,"I truly love this iPhone application As someone who is completely blind. I have only one thing that could make this app better. Please add a PDF conversion channel. I cannot even say how many times I receive digital documents from professors and others in my college experience. This is just something that is essential for me personally, but if it was able to be added to the app that would be great.",11/07/18 5:22,5
Be My Eyes,Great Service ! Just got help. Magnificent! 🎼🎶🎵 And the volunteer was another Veteran. 🇺🇸,04/11/20 14:03,5

Be My Eyes,"An inspiring combination of thoughtful design, compassion and simplicity.",07/04/19 19:24,5
Be My Eyes,"Magnificent idea Hope to add more options for more specification to make the people who needs help more comfortable Like gender even helper or requester, geographic area, age range As this may give both parts of the call more relieved and not being shy specifically girls as they have more private needs which men might not be able to understand or fulfill",05/20/21 10:27,5
Be My Eyes,It's a rewarding feeling when I am able to help someone it does makes me sad sometimes when I am unable to help them because I cannot read the letters properly I wish that problem was solved,05/29/22 2:30,4
Be My Eyes,Definitely one of my favourite apps. Have used it so many times when I suddenly realise I could really do with a pair of eyes. A big thank you to everyone who volunteers for this service. There’s a couple of small parts of my life that I really could not do without you.,07/03/21 6:08,5
Be My Eyes,I love this! I’ve had it for about a year and have done about 5 calls. The callers are very professional and helpful with getting me to help them.,04/01/21 21:36,5
TapTapSee,"Take a picture of what ever is in front of you, this app will tell you what it is, and it will tell you what color it is. Quite amazing, and fun too. I wonder how it works?",01/28/15 11:59,5
Be My Eyes,"It's an undoubtedly a wondrous initiative to help the blind people. My personal experience has been very good- I was able to answer few calls and help the needy blind people in solving their minor problems such as the text/captcha code reading, identify some documentation, etc. I really liked the app and strongly encourage others to use it to ease the lives of blind people.",01/05/22 2:27,5
Be My Eyes,Tried to install. Couldn't get passed 50%,03/31/20 3:16,3
RightHear - Blind Assistant,A much needed aid for the visually impaired,02/08/17 5:12,5
Be My Eyes,I just answered my first call and was able to identify the bottles for the nice woman who called.  What a great use of technology!,09/17/18 18:17,5
Be My Eyes,Be My Eyes is such a blessing.  I am able to assist others throughout the day. It is so warm to the soul to provide basic needs.  To help others better their day.   Thank you for allowing me the honor and privilege of helping others,07/14/24 15:15,5
Be My Eyes,"I work in a doctor’s office and learned about BME through a patient telling me she sometimes has to use the app to tell which prescription is which when her usual pharmacy that offers braille labels isn’t available to fill a script. Everyone on our staff immediately downloaded the app, and anytime we get a notification to accept!  I’ve only gotten to help just a single person so far, but as a volunteer, this app really gives us a sense of what it means to be human, to give back to humanity, unselfishly. If more of us gave so freely of just a few minutes of our time each month, collectively, think of what else we could accomplish!
Don’t download the app to make yourself feel better. That’s a selfish reason. But if that just happens to be a consequence of wanting to help others, then that’s what humanity is about!",07/25/18 17:45,5
Be My Eyes,"As a sighted person we take so much for granted. If you have a visual impairment, then life can present many every-day challenges, like choosing the right colour shirt when going out or sorting through a few bottles of spices in the kitchen. That’s where Be My Eyes can be an instant life line for thousands of people every day.

As someone with visual impairment you can ask someone at any time and as many times as you need. Due to the large helper database of very willing volunteers you will always get a helping hand and you’re very unlikely to get the same person twice. This means that there is always a willing volunteer waiting to take your call - so what are you waiting for?

As a volunteer you will be notified, occasionally, when someone needs help of a sighted person. An alert pops up on your phone / tablet and you have a few seconds to answer the call. If you don’t because you’re busy, don’t worry someone else will answer usually in a few seconds and you’ll be notified that the call has already been answered. If you’re lucky enough to be able to help someone and answer a call then you will see a live stream from someone looking for assistance. You may need to provide some helpful instructions to the person so that the phone camera is showing what you need to see in order to help. Then just chat away and provide the help required.

As there are so many volunteers the number of calls received in my experience is very low, maybe one call per 30-60 days on average. 

In short this app is an inspiration and I cannot recommend it enough.",10/23/19 0:53,5
Be My Eyes,App works flawlessly.,08/14/22 21:15,5
Seeing Eye GPS,"I think this is a cool app, however, I think the price is too high. I think with a name like this Seeing Eye, it seems like they should be getting some sort of money for putting their name behind this app. I would think, that if the Seeing I were getting donations, people wouldn't have such a problem with the price point.",07/05/13 13:40,1
Be My Eyes,Great app for great cause,07/17/19 2:42,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,Hello I purchased this app today while it was on sale. I like the feature when I read the text to you it tells you where to position the phone so it captures all the text is so quick and fast. I can say it does a much better job than other apps out there! This will be an excellent purchase if you are going to school or for work or just to read a print book that happens to be on your book shelf.,07/22/21 13:44,5
Be My Eyes,"I love using this app on a daily basis. I have a feature suggestion, though that could make the app even better. That is the ability to save the photos that you analyze with the app with the descriptions that the app gives. There are other apps that do this, and I believe that this would make this app even better.",12/21/24 4:21,5
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded the app a few months ago. I got my first call a few weeks ago helping a woman read her insurance card while she was sitting at a diner eating breakfast! How cool is that? A simple iPhone app just changed the game for the visually impaired. Whoever thought this up, good job!",08/18/17 13:39,5
Be My Eyes,This app makes it really easy to help those that cannot see. Easy to answer calls and not a heavy lift.,02/03/22 18:51,5
Be My Eyes,I just received my first call and it only took one day!! It was a lady asking the color of a shirt. We were both excited she was my first call! I can’t wait to get more calls. This app is amazing. Whoever thought of this deserves an award.,08/23/20 14:37,5
Be My Eyes,Great app with great idea. The founder gave me a good laugh in a email conversation I had with him and was a good sport about it so +1 for that.,12/07/17 15:10,5
Be My Eyes,"Great app! There are so many volunteers, that I have never actually been able to help anyone. This is not a complaint, just an indication of how many great people out there, who want to help!",09/14/17 16:33,5
Be My Eyes,"I noticed the app in the App Store and decided to download. This was nearly two weeks ago as I guess I was a little skeptical to use it. This past Sunday as I was getting ready to go to lunch, I pulled out a chain that I wanted to put a gold pendant on.  Now...is the chain silver or gold?  I asked myself as if I knew. So, I figured this may be a good time to try Be My Eyes...After creating my account I was connected with a very kind young lady who was able to tell me the chain was gold!  What a huge help to this blind lady who loves her jewelry and clothes! Thank you Be My Eyes and thank you to the awesome volunteers who truly can make a difference in peoples lives.  The only downside is I really wish Be My Eyes had been around before I lost my sight because I would have loved to have been a volunteer!!",04/03/19 1:21,5
Be My Eyes,very worst app call is not received by anyone for long,04/24/19 19:55,1
Be My Eyes,"The phone calls are infrequent, but when they come through they’re usually quick and simple like helping someone count their money, locate an object, sign a check, setup Bluetooth/Wifi devices, and so on. 

Never stressful and always feel great after helping someone. Kind of wish more calls came through :)",06/06/24 17:41,5

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,It's a good app,12/26/19 12:15,5
Envision AI,"I'm not so happy with this app. Colour reader is simply included here. It tells all the names of colour, but it is never perfact. This feature should ve removed. However, loading of files for reading should ve faster and it can be done. You are charging some money that is ok but users should have the good service.",02/02/20 2:31,2
Be My Eyes,"Simple idea but utter genius! You get an alert, shown a video link to a blind or visually impaired person. You see what they can't and talk to them. Could be which is an item of clothing or expiry date or product ingredients. Easy, simple way to make a small but significant difference to a blind person.",12/28/19 17:46,5
Digit-Eyes,"On buying the app found finding UPC codes impossible as blind, and no demo so disappointed",06/25/10 15:03,2

Doesn’t respond to voice commands 
Has small buttons so it can save space for the on screen image - For Blind people!!!! 
Worst of all it cannot recognise actual things such as tomatoes.",05/21/23 2:09,1
Be My Eyes,Any time you can make an app that will help others then it’s a very good app,01/29/19 17:26,5
Be My Eyes,"I recently read about someone who had troubles getting help because nobody answered. Well, I always try to answer, but I have to unlock my phone first. By the time I get it unlocked, the call has been passed to someone else. If I have more than a few seconds to answer, I would be able to answer more often. It would be great if the request came through as a FaceTime call; I think I don’t have to unlock my phone for that. Furthermore, I would be more useful if I could set my app to available or unavailable when I’m sitting idle or driving. Because of the issues I have answering and the rarity of requests, I have often considered deleting the app altogether. 
 Other than my two complaints, I have enjoyed the app. I really enjoyed helping the two folks I was able to assist. I’ll be honest, I get really excited when the opportunity to help someone arises. Helping others is what I enjoy most in life, but I would like more opportunities to do so. Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes for creating something so wonderful. I don’t expect it to be perfect, but I hope my feedback helps improve the experience for everyone.",08/17/18 0:28,4

Be My Eyes,"Love this app, have had it for years now and it's sometimes pretty rare to get a call. I've helped a lady that was visually impaired who herself helped others. They girl she was with was hesitant about using this app so we just talked a little about calls I've helped others on and explained to her that no request would be to small for her to use this. Helped another gentleman bake a cake even lol. Have recommended to all of my friends and family.",02/01/22 7:25,5

Seeing AI,"Overall, I have found this app very useful and accomplishing day-to-day tasks such as identifying canned goods or sorting the mail. However, it is very inconsistent ( and unacceptably so) in its ability to read the output of digital displays. FYI, I am speaking throughout this review of the short text channel. I use this app every day to read my kitchen scale for making coffee and for other reasons. At times, it reads the output quickly and accurately. At other times, it takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to read the display. Words are inadequate to describe the frustration I feel when a 30-second task turns into a 10-minute one, draining my phone battery all the while. If a pair of human eyeballs can read the display, then there should be no reason why Seeing AI cannot also read it. This problem seems particularly exacerbated by readings that end in either 1 or 7 (such as 21 G). The app has no problem reading the labels of the buttons on the scale, but it all too often fails to read literally the only thing on the display I want to hear. Perhaps a new channel could be created in the app that is optimized specifically for the reading of displays. Please work on this! In a world in which many home appliances are still inaccessible, it is more important than ever that blind people have access to an app like Seeing AI that is capable of reading a display. My rating reflects the frustration caused by the app's seeming inability to accomplish one of its core functions in situations that I need it most. I commit to updating my rating when this issue is addressed.",04/26/24 18:08,2

Be My Eyes,Not sure why but I have received only one call and it was prankster pretending to be blind. They started swearing and verbally abusing me while I was with my children. No way to report them either. Disappointed that people are using this as a joke and taking away from people who actually need help. I'll keep the app for now but the next time it happens I'm removing it. There should be a way to report these jerks.,11/21/21 9:56,1

Be My Eyes,"The concept is simple and it’s been effectively implemented as far as I can tell from using it so far. I also find the community stories that are shared inspiring and useful. Often they help me to see what I am either blind or only partially able to see, namely my own implicit assumptions about what it’s like to be visually impaired. It helps me also to glimpse what incredible untapped potential we all have within us. In being of help I find I am being helped and that’s a real blessing. Thank you.",11/24/20 3:03,5

Be My Eyes,"I could not think of a more valiant way to use your phone to help others for free. No ads, no deceitfulness, no monthly charges. No gimmicks or tricks. Just a clean, true to purpose app in which people needing sight related help can call upon willing volunteers in real time. If you are busy, you don’t have to worry because of the vast amount of volunteers, the call will get answered. In fact, once you help a person or two you’ll be scrambling to answer that special ring! There’s no better feeling than helping another living being. The developers of this app should be knighted or gifted houses and cars or something. I hope they continue making these rare gems. Maybe bring back Yitien! Lol",04/19/22 6:58,5

Seeing AI,"So happy to see you finally added Philippine peso. Thanks much
One more thing I have a suggestion if possible can you put a tone or vibrate notification in the app to let us know that the app is still open so we won’t forget to close it because the camera will still be on sometimes and I forget. Cash reader has such a thing and it’s very good because you do know you need to close the app.",12/11/21 1:15,5

Be My Eyes,"I've never experienced any technical issues, and it feels great to help people!",11/15/16 0:02,5
Be My Eyes,"It’s a great idea but I never get any calls (1-2 per week).I think they should make a setting so that people with the app open to a certain space will be routed to a call and if not enough people have their apps open, they can go to the current system.

As other reviewers have noted, an earlier version of the app required an internet/wifi connection to function. However, I spoke to the app developers about this, and they have removed this restriction in a recent release, and I was very impressed that they responded to user feedback in this way.  The interface isn't perfect though -- I think there are some improvements that could be made to make it easier to use for people with poor sight.",12/31/15 9:37,5

Be My Eyes,The app seems to be focusing too much on collecting the volunteers email and getting permission to send spam. You can't start anything without giving a real email (already a red flag). And the home screen is designed to eventually get your consent to send spam. There is no simple opt out. That doesn't seem like the purpose of the app is helping blind people. It's collecting your data.,04/24/20 11:41,1

I haven't either, but the app seems to be a great start to assisting people that ask for help. The set-up and functions are easy to follow, great that it runs in the background, nice that there is a point reward system.

It is also better than any OCR app I have tried, use it to read  directions off of boxes of food and medication.

I said no.. then I saw a button that turn on the flash light of caller mobile. I clicked it. In the light I saw a hand holding an Identity card. The caller asked me can you tell me what is the date of printing of this card ...I read whatever I saw in the Identity card then I request him to show the backside of the card ...there it was the date of printing. I told him it was printed today only. He thanked me...I asked him from where you are he responded Delhi........the whole conversation was in Hindi.I felt great by helping a Blind person....you can do this help too.. just few minutes of your time can help a blind person manage small task which is difficult to do without eyes....... कुछ मिनट पहले मेरे मोबाइल पर एक कॉल आया। जब मैंने कॉल उठाया तो मैंने एक पिच डार्क स्क्रीन देखी और एक आवाज आई ""सर, आपको कुछ दिख रहा है?"" मैंने कहा नहीं.. फिर मैंने एक बटन देखा जो कॉलर मोबाइल की फ्लैश लाइट चालू करता है। मैंने इसे क्लिक किया। रोशनी में मैंने एक हाथ में पहचान पत्र पकड़े देखा। फोन करने वाले ने मुझसे पूछा कि क्या आप मुझे बता सकते हैं कि इस कार्ड की छपाई की तारीख क्या है ... मैंने पहचान पत्र में जो कुछ भी देखा, मैंने उससे कार्ड का पिछला भाग दिखाने का अनुरोध किया ... वहां छपाई की तारीख थी . मैंने उससे कहा कि यह आज ही छपा है। उसने मुझे धन्यवाद दिया...मैंने उससे पूछा कि तुम कहाँ से हो उसने जवाब दिया दिल्ली.......पूरी बातचीत हिंदी में थी।मुझे एक अंधे व्यक्ति की मदद करके बहुत अच्छा लगा....आप भी यह मदद कर सकते हैं। आपके समय के कुछ ही मिनट नेत्रहीन व्यक्ति को छोटे से छोटे कार्य को संभालने में मदद कर सकते हैं जो बिना आंखों के करना मुश्किल है .......",03/07/22 5:32,5

Be My Eyes,"Absolutely love the idea of this app!! what makes it really nice is that there’s so many volunteers that even if you couldn’t answer the call, there are millions others that are able to! You don’t have to feel guilty :) I have downloaded the app since November last year, but I have unfortunately not gotten a call yet. I am excited to receive one soon. I hope I can help the person with whatever they need.🤍🤍🤍",04/29/23 19:14,5

Be My Eyes,"What a wonderful app! I'm a volunteer, and it's so good to see that the number of volunteers VS the number of blind users is so much higher - proof that there is good in this world. It's super easy to use, you answer the video call and the video chat starts. Since there are so many volunteers, you won't answer that many calls, so every now and then, make sure you're still logged in.",02/02/23 17:36,5
Be My Eyes,"I think this is a great app in general. I was a little bummed out when I learned that because there are significantly more volunteers than there are blind people on the app, you don’t get a call very often. I’ve had this for Over a year and I’ve only ever gotten five calls, and only one of which I was able to answer in time. The others I actually missed because the alert sound was so quiet and I couldn’t hear it. It does have a unique ring that doesn’t sound like any of your other alert sounds, but it’s very hard to hear if you’re not sitting in a totally quiet room. If the calls had been louder, I probably would have been able to answer them in time. Also, if you miss a call, it does not leave you an alert saying that you missed one. You have to see it ring to even know you missed an alert.There is also no history log of how many calls you’ve received or how many people you’ve helped… Which is fine but it would be nice to be able to go and look back and see how many calls you’ve missed and taken and how many people you’ve helped, etc. 
I was really disappointed when I missed my second call because I really enjoyed answering the very first call I ever got. I certainly don’t wish that there were more blind people that need help, and it’s great that so many people want to volunteer to help, but I just wish I had more opportunities to use this app more than once a year. That is a selfish point of view though, because this is otherwise a really great tool. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys helping other people.",10/05/21 19:13,5
Be My Eyes,"I just download it, this is the best app in the world. It actually helps people I haven't got a call yet but am excited to help anyone in need.

OneStep Reader,This app is okay if you are using it to quickly read something a menu price tag a quick description of something but I attempted to use it to read a textbook and it does not help it doesn't have the right pauses doesn't recognize a grouping of a sentence it will stop mid-sentence or mid paragraph and then resume it also doesn't read things left to right such as a chart it reads it top to bottom so it's just not helpful in the manner that I expected to use it I definitely don't think it's worth the price,02/01/18 11:24,3

Seeing AI,"the updates keep getting better, from the jumping text, they fixed it, to the document channel being sluggish and now that's fixed. microsoft is doing an excellent job and no account needed and this all free. love it. my one thing is I would love the seen preview and where you share photos from the share sheet to have a way to interact with the AI like you can now in the document channel. these guys brought much more rich descriptions to the seen and share sheets, but theres no interactions with it, if you could ask it followup you would have a 5 star app I think. edit, you can now ask seeingAI questions about your photo, this is fantastic.   I have no problem recommending this app and the other thing i'll say is working with microsoft's seeingAI staff via email you get quick responces. I do not work with them but what I mean is like emailing them, their turnaround time has ben rather snappy I feel. they seem to really get blind people with their seeingAI here and its just getting better.edit, as of Version 5.5, the interface is much more streamlined, I didn't think it possible to make it any easier but they did, and they blended a few channels into one, like the read tab is short text and document all in one and you also have the option to toggle with a button with document alignment and you can even take a photo in that tab. theres so much more they did and its just excellent and we still get access to the older stuff. I love the describe tab updates, now you get a rich description right out of the gate when you snap a photo or load one. its excellent thank you so much Microsoft and team over at seeing AI.",02/08/25 16:05,5

Be My Eyes,I'm giving only four stars because it's a very good concept but it takes a little while for anyone to get a call and help someone so they think that this app is just going to be a waste of space so maybe you could try to get on local news to see if anyone that doesn't know about this app specially blind people know about it so we can get more calls and like people can feel better about themselves,04/14/21 20:06,4

Be My Eyes,Since I’ve had the app I have had two calls of which both did not work properly. The first one connected but the video was not working and so I couldn’t see anything and couldn’t help. The second call just said answering after I picked up and then dropped saying error you will be disconnected. It really needs to work better so I can help anybody who rings please!!!,04/17/19 13:35,1
Be My Eyes,"3/5 Stars While the idea is great the user interface and features aren’t the best.
-First, Once I created my account I wasn’t even sure if the app worked. Does the app have to be open to receive a call or does it run in the background. I was under the impression that I want running in the background because the little triangle in the upper right hand, the one that tells you an app was recently using your location, was not present. So that one problem that I saw with the app, I wasn’t sure if the app was working properly. 
-Second, there seems to be a lot of “trolls” on the internet and Im concerned that they could be misguiding the blind by giving them wrong information. I think there needs to be a way to separate those who genuinely help and those who are trying to pull a prank, I think there should be a rating system of some sort where users can have a rating or something so the “most helpful” stand out. 
-Third, is there  a way of turning the service off? I would love for the app to be running in the background so I may be of assistance to the blind in need but I think there should be a way to pause or temporarily shut off the service, like at night when your trying to get sleep. But over all, great idea and concept, just some issues that I’m sure will be fixed in future updates.",01/22/15 0:49,3

Also think that use of English is rather confusing. For example, there is a button that says callout! This should really be “where am I“.

Be My Eyes,Awesome app :) I'm anxious to get my first call and help someone.,12/19/17 4:27,5
Be My Eyes,"Amazing idea, and super easy to use. The only downside is that because there are so many volunteers, it might be a while before you get your first call. But answering calls and helping is simple and people are very appreciative.",04/30/19 11:34,5

Be My Eyes,"We’ve gotten two calls from people needing help reading their medication bottles. The information is blurred out each time. I’m pretty certain it’s a privacy thing. Not sure if the issue is through FaceTime or the app itself, but it’s kind of a big deal. Obviously the people need help reading it, we’re volunteering to help. I could care less about their medical information.",07/08/21 20:56,4

It wouldn't let me give a thumbs down rating so I went to the app and tried to give feedback, letting them know about the issue because it seemed pretty important. Again I couldn't give feedback on the app so I decided to come here, hoping they read the reviews so they become aware of what just happened. We'll.",05/19/23 10:34,1

OneStep Reader,"In a recent update the speach rate settings are bad.  First of all the range of speach rate is unnessessary.  From way too slow to way too fast.  Secondly, when set on 48 is normal (for me), but slide it to 52 and it's way too fast.  ????  Lastly, when I'm finally able to get the speach rate set it goes back to the default setting every time I close the program.  The default setting is insanely slow.  This whole ""Speach Rate"" issue is very frustrating and needs to be addressed.  Otherwise the app works well.

Seeing AI,"Very good at doing so many things and a fun way to play around with image detection AI!  Barcode reader is the best one I've ever used. Face detection seems extremely well implemented, I was able to quickly take a nicely framed up selfie using the back camera and the audio cues from the app. It tells you the subject's gender, age, and mood.  And then there's the scene detection where you take a picture and it does its best to describe what it sees. It's not always accurate but it's usually pretty close, and sometimes it can come up with some interesting feedback. 

Everything feels VERY snappy, at least on my iPhone 7 Plus on my home WiFi. The voice is so responsive and quick that using the app feels almost futuristic at times. This is the main thing that differentiates this from things I've seen before. It feels a bit like an Apple product— none of these AI technologies is new, but it's the first time they are all together in one accessible place and so well executed. 

The only thing that didn't work for me was the document detection feature, I tried many times to scan a receipt on A4 paper from an online purchase and it appeared to recognize the geometry of the paper very well and quickly asked me to hold still but then said there wasn't any text found while displaying a black screen where there would normally be an image. Apparently a minor bug which I hope they'll hammer out in the next release. 

I truly believe this app will help many people with vision impairment. Thank you for your hard work on making something great!",07/13/17 10:21,5

Just concerned that the text and icons are too small/non-distinct to navigate for someone with very little sight. Also when scanning a document sometimes you would not want all the information to be read out. Ideally it would be better if you could highlight or touch the relevant text you would like to have read out.

Be My Eyes,I REALLY love the idea of helping blind or low sighted people all over the world with just a call. Right now its over 2 million volunteers and about 100 thousand low sighted/blind people that could call you and it only takes about 1-5 minutes helping them out. Mostly you get asked simple questions like what color a shirt has for example. It always makes me feel happier after helping a person and maybe even making their day a little better. (Everyone I met so far was really sweet and polite.),10/17/19 18:09,5
Be My Eyes,What a fantastic app. Easy to take 2 mins out to help someone. Makes you feel good to be human. Just had my 3rd call now (since march) so you don't get too many. Only improvement i would suggest is being able to put yourself up to take more calls,11/09/17 13:53,5
OneStep Reader,"I miss the easy way you use to be able to access imported files from another app, it use to be that explorer was at the top of the screen and tapping on this instantly opened your imported file.  Also ever since IOS12 the app will throw you back to the home screen upon launching however it remains active, going to the app switcher and taping on it will put you right back at the home screen.
Other than that it is a very accurate app and I know yall willl fix the IOS12 issues",10/13/18 10:03,4

Be My Eyes,"My favorite part of this app is the artificial intelligence image recognition model that was added recently. However, it also has its problems. Today, my mom and I went out to IHOP for brunch. I scanned the menu with my phone and asked my AI to describe the menu. it told me that the pancake of the month was a stack of buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup and a dollop of butter. But when the waiter brought up my food, she brought out a stack of pancakes with raspberry sauce on top. Turns out the pancake of the month was actually a stack of raspberry pancakes. The AI model had made a mistake when describing the menu. I personally love open AI, I use ChatGPT all the time. I was surprised that such an advanced image recognition model could mess up like that. I hope you guys improve the AI model you put in this app, and I hope you get rid of some bugs, and hopefully this model will be better at reading menus",05/05/24 17:06,3

Seeing AI,"I installed this app the day I first heard of it, while listening to the ACB national convention nearly two years ago.  Even though I had had KNFB Reader for a number of years, I mainly added this one for comparison, but soon discovered that it compares favorably with the aforementioned app, as well as with other light-detecting, color-identifying and currency-reading apps I have used over the last five years. I soon realized that I needed to get a newer iPhone in order to use the Products feature—which I did.  I use the app just about every day, for everything from reading mail to reading books, some magazines, and cooking instructions on that packaged dinner I just pulled out of the freezer, and even making sure that coupon I plan to use at a local business hasn’t expired.  The Short Text works especially well, for those times you don’t wish to scan an entire document.  For most things, the Document channel works well, and I like it that the focusing is done automatically.  However, there are occasions when I get the “No text recognized” alert; so then, I revert to KNFB Reader, and sometimes it does a better job reading that document.  I am totally blind from birth; so I am assuming that the documents for which I get that alert are those printed in multiple colors, and with numerous graphics that land smack in the middle of the written text.  I can’t vouch for the color identifier channel—as I have never been able to see color; but, knowing that lighting can affect the way color is perceived—even by a good set of eyes—my take is that any attempt at a color identifier is better than none at all.  The currency reader has improved markedly since the app first came out.  I have been able to read a number of handwritten greeting cards—and other items as well—with the Handwriting channel.  The light detector has saved me any amount of grief, since I have a number of light switches (for overhead lights, of course), which are push-buttons rather than up-and-down toggles; and, we all know people who can’t remember to turn the lights off when they leave.  I’ve had considerable fun with the Scene channel, which is often quite accurate.  I have occasionally had a bit of difficulty getting the bar-code reader (Product channel) to work; but then, bar codes aren’t always in the same location on a box or container.  Just today, I had to search diligently for the bar code on a frozen meal, in order to then read the cooking instructions.  By the time I found and read that information, my battery status had dropped precipitously, from 85 to 60 percent!  If one is using the app for any length of time at a stretch, I suggest that they either have their phone plugged in, or have an external battery handy, as it is a major drain.  On the other hand, this afternoon I was able to read an online menu—which was otherwise totally inaccessible because it was an _image— from a local restaurant.  In this case, SeeingAI did a better job reading it than KNFB Reader!  Finally, to those who insist that there is no currency reader channel, could it be that they are still on an iPhone 5S or earlier?  And to those who insist that the app doesn’t work well with VoiceOver, perhaps they are just new to VoiceOver and need help with it?  This has really been a life-changing app!  I look forward to even more improvements and enhancements, and apologize for the length of this review.",05/26/19 16:28,5

Ii had serious back surgery a few months ago and can't work. I feel very purposeless. This app came along, and who knew you could assist folks who just need your eyes for a moment. I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS APP! Send more calls, please!",03/20/23 16:17,3
Be My Eyes,..hate it,01/27/21 17:40,1

Be My Eyes,"Love the peculiar sound of the app when someone needs help! I have helped a musician, people that need me to see if the medication they are about to take is the right bottle, see the correct measurement of insuline, look for an object lost in the floor, make sure the color of their socks is the same, see the number of the pages in a brochure for a college professor. Beautiful app that leaves you as a volunteer, feeling great. (I signed up for Spanish and English).",05/15/21 18:31,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this service and I’m so honored to he s seeing volunteer.

Be My Eyes,Good jobs guys! Well designed and easy to use app.,06/21/16 15:31,5
Be My Eyes,What an incredible idea to help someone in need. This is one app that should be in everyone's phone. Nobody will say No if someone who cannot see needs help.,03/05/19 5:53,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,It's an amazing app buddy needs more languages and needs improvements to recognize more objects in also needs the translation mode sees there a lot of things great and in different languages and sometimes we don't have the possibility to get the translation so I think there would be much better if there was a translation load though it be more beneficial to everybody,05/24/19 13:45,5

Be My Eyes,What a beautiful sweet app!,01/24/23 3:42,5

I am usually asked to help read letters, ingredients, or instructions, or identify a color. All very easy tasks for me! And I usually am on the call for 2 minutes or less. I love this app and what it does! Great job.",12/10/22 3:13,5

OneStep Reader,"My experience is it's highly expensive, otherwise the past couple times that I have tried to use it, it has been okay. It recognized text.

Be My Eyes,I had my first call today and it went really well!! The man I assisted was really polite and grateful and I was happy to help. While this was my first call I noted a few weeks ago I got a call around 3 am and was fast asleep. A suggestion I had would be to let us set hours where we are usually awake and available to help. Maybe this will help connect people faster. So amazed by what you people do!,03/03/23 19:42,5

Be My Eyes,"I have been a part of the Be My Eyes community since 2015. 

Be My Eyes is hands down my favorite app on my phone. I don’t get calls very often thanks to the millions of sighted people who have joined the community, but when I do, I try to answer as fast as I can. 

It’s usually something pretty simple. 

“Can you help me see what my thermostat is set at?”

“Can you tell me which yoga pants are black and which are blue?”

“Trying to heat up this frozen lasagna, what do I need to preset my over to and how long does it need to cook?”

I take 5 minutes out of my day to help a fellow human get through their day. Couldn’t be more simple. Couldn’t be more rewarding. 

I hesitate to even post this, as the more sighted people join, the fewer opportunities I get to help. But it’s a net gain for the app and community the more people join.",03/03/22 2:14,5
Be My Eyes,It keeps asking me to give a review but I’ve had the app for about two weeks now and I haven’t received a call. So there’s nothing to rate.,07/25/19 11:29,1
Be My Eyes,I live alone and get frustrated when I drop something and can’t find it. Especially if it’s able to roll across the floor. Be my eyes has help me find things that drop.

Be My Eyes,I really love this app I feel so great to be able to help someone who needs help I've had this app for a while now and the people that are impaired are always so nice if you don’t have patience then this is not the app for you…it feels good to give back and make someones life a little easier it’s definitely a pleasure and good deed to assist others who need a little extra help♥️👏🏾,02/23/23 17:19,5

Be My Eyes,Good apps. But a bit troublesome for volunteers to answer the calls when the phone is locked. Because i have to unlock the phone first to answer the calls.

BlindSquare,To hear to speech synthesizer’s talking at the same time is a bit much. I have sensory overload and that can be a bit of a toll. I thought this would help and it doesn’t. I can’t even log into my Swarm account. I put in the right password so that I could link this but apparently I can’t. This app made a lot of improvement in my personal opinion. This is why I gave it a one star review. I’m hoping to talk to the developer so that maybe there would be a demo of the app before you buy it instead of spending the $39.99 for it. I got this app on my phone and was immediately displeased with it.,08/03/23 20:45,1

Be My Eyes,"Love the idea of this app. One thing I don't like though, is that when it rings, it's very quiet, and I can't answer it like a phone call. I have to wake up my phone, unlock it, then go to the notification of the incoming call.",10/23/17 10:51,1

Be My Eyes,"I have been a volunteer since May but answered my first call today! I was able to assist a lady in Chile, who spoke Spanish, to read the medicine she needed to take, and the dosage. She told me it was her first time, and asked me what kind of other help could she get, asked me if she could get help with colors on clothes, and if she could access help 24hrs a day. She was so pleased to know we can help her with anything she needs help seeing, and that she had support all day. There are more volunteers than the blind, so you will not be answering a calls everyday. The more help there is the better. Please download this app❤️",07/02/18 3:38,5

Be My Eyes,"My only problem is that it often takes too long to open the app to answer, and the call rolls to the next person. I'm hoping the latest version solves this, in which case I will up my rating to 5 stars. 
One of the calls I received was from a woman who said it changed her life by giving her more independence.",10/11/17 2:23,4

Be My Eyes,I just downloaded the app I can't wait to help other people,01/03/21 11:05,5
Be My Eyes,"I have been using this app for 6 months and this app is very useful. If any visually impaired person is living in this world and is using a smartphone, then he must install this application on his phone and it can help you. Sometimes there may be no one sitting around you. In such a situation, you can talk to them and rotate your phone's camera in all directions and ask them questions and they will answer your questions very quickly. The behaviour of their volunteer team is also very good.",05/16/24 23:11,5

BlindSquare,"BlindSquare is not only a powerful navigational tool that is fully nonvisually accessible, it is a platform that allows optimal user control over the content, effectively placing the blind user in the driver's seat. Its great for tinckerers, if the imagination can go there, the developers want to know about it so they can take it there. Its also great for the minimalist; ""just tell me where I am and where I'm going and I'm good to go. """,04/10/15 13:15,5

Be My Eyes,"This has a reasonable interface and is very easy to use. I also really like its principle and I think it's really good, except I would appreciate the ability to set times when I am definitely not available to avoid being disturbed during classes etc. and so that if I happen to be a person who is called upon to help, the person has more people at their disposal for assistance and a higher chance of being helped asap",01/29/18 12:40,4

Be My Eyes,"I had my first call today and the experience was wonderful. Just the feeling that you can help someone just by over the phone, the little stuff we take for granted is just a life changing experience when you can help someone with a daily task that we look at as a complaint.

TapTapSee,"Not only does it do a good job of identifying things when you take a picture, I accidentally discovered that it will lookup a barcode if you hold it in front of the camera. It does the lookup in real time, no snapping a picture.   This is an awesome app. The developer should include a donate with PayPal button. I would support this functionality.",03/03/16 5:33,5

I was very excited when I got it and after time I have overall forgotten I have it. I want to help but when I don't get the opportunity, it feels useless. It seems kind of pointless to keep it. Update: It has been been 8 months now and I have been contacted by 1 person. Im deleting this app.",05/17/19 1:34,1

Be My Eyes,"Hello Be My Eyes. I don't want to give you a 1 star because it is a BRILLIANT idea. It just doesn't work on my Samsung phone (not more than a year old). I have the same problem as the other volunteers - I've had several calls but they all give me a spinning wheel and I cannot answer them. Many thanks, Dan",05/11/22 13:25,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this opportunity to help people even though I’ve only received about five phone calls in two years. That’s a good sign there’s probably enough volunteers. I’ve enjoyed helping three different people in different circumstances needing help.
One gal needed help as she opened a new box of tennis shoes to make sure she got what she bought. 
Another young man asked me to help read some packages so he could finish making homemade cookies.
Another older gentleman was sneaking outside to have a cigarette with a friend and dropped his lighter. It was a dark and it was pretty funny trying to find it, on the ground with his phone, and then tried to direct him towards picking it up. His left was not my left LOL
it’s a great app and I wish more people new about it.",08/20/19 20:03,5
Be My Eyes,"per some old reviews I read regarding muting the app notifications only, not your whole phone: the app now has a setting to make notifications vibrate / ring & more. You can even customize the notification souns",02/03/19 6:29,5
Seeing AI,"This app used to be great, but it got much worse with the new “streamlined“ interface. The instant read function never worked well, but the handwriting channel was awesome. Combining those was a huge mistake. Once your app updates to the new version with the new integrated reading tool, you can’t go back to the good one. Hopefully they can fix the reading problem in the future.",02/22/25 14:01,2

But I'm forever a member.,06/09/24 17:01,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Finally - a free app for the blind that helps us live more independently. While I appreciate the different modes the currency option should inform you which side of the bill is showing and whether it's right side up or upside down.

Seeing AI,I depend on this🦯,02/13/25 1:09,5
Be My Eyes,Hi! I would really love for the app to have a report button of some sort. I just got a call of help from the app unfortunately the person calling us showing his private part to me. I feel like such person should not be allowed to continue to be in that app as for no other people to fall his victim. Hopefully you can consider this idea.,10/30/21 2:10,1

Be My Eyes,"I mainly use this app to describe images via Be My AI, and I have noticed that it’s not always consistent or accurate. So I did a test on myself. I asked Be My AI if the person in the picture has wrinkles and facial lines. It said, ‘yes.” Well I know for a fact that I don’t have any wrinkles or facial lines. So I said, “Really?” Then it responded, “I apologize for any confusion. Upon closer look, the person does not have any lines or wrinkles. The person’s face is very smooth.” LOL! If you want to know how someone looks, my advice is ask the person directly. I haven’t used their volunteer services yet. It’s still a great app though!",08/18/24 1:54,4

Be My Eyes,"This is an AMAZING opportunity to volunteer wherever you are! It's a simple video call from a blind person who needs a little help from a sighted person. I think everyone should have this APP. Why not help someone? Volunteering always makes me feel amazing, but THIS...the feeling is incredible.  It's a way to make a difference; sure it may be in a small way...at least it may seem small to you...until you hear the gratitude in there voice when they say thanks/thank you for your help/and the list goes on.  The climate in the US related to political things has this country the most divided in my lifetime; so WHY NOT take a moment to help someone...you never know how big or small, sorry for the rant ppl I am just passionate about focusing on good and positive things. So, get off social media once and while and use this app. It takes so little space. I hope this app keeps growing and surpasses every goal the developer/creators had. Currently there are approximately 60 thousand non-sighted/impaired sighted individuals on this app and approximately 800 thousand sighted ppl. I hope it continues to evolve to help ppl even more people and in more ways. An unsolicited plug for this app, to stop what you're doing and download it. And ppl out there, PLEASE volunteer in your community as well!  Hats off to the creators and developers of this app! The world needs more positivity and ways to help fellow man.",01/06/18 18:03,5

Be My Eyes,"This is a great app especially when I go away for work and I'm staying in hotels. It's wonderful to just be able to connect to be my eyes and get someone to help me find the apple juice or help me change the air conditioner or heater in the room. It's nice to be able to do things without always having to ask someone else for help or find someone to ask for help. I really appreciate it and it's great to show clients as well. I am a vision rehabilitation therapist and I show this app to clients all the time. The volunteers are very patient and very nice. I really appreciate their effort and time.
My only complaint would be that it takes a lot of time at times to connect to a volunteer. If this issue could be fixed this would be even better.",06/09/15 21:06,4

Be My Eyes,I joined this app August 2023. a couple weeks in I received my first call which I answered after the 2nd ring and was told someone else answered the call quicker than me. Since then never received a call ever again. The concept is great but at this point it's just taking up space in my phone if they are never going to contact me so unfortunately will be uninstalling. Such a shame as I genuinely wanted to help someone!,03/31/25 2:24,1
Seeing AI,"This app makes my life much easier. While not being totally blind but with about 5% vision I can still see the little icons in the bottom. Haven’t used everything yet but the short text, document reader, currency, and color has come in very handy. You know you don’t want to look silly and where mismatch clothes lol.

So I just use the product tab and figured out there was another icon that it would read me more information. The short text doesn’t always read the instructions well for heating but the extra product info gave me all the information I needed. This app matched with my Alexa microwave/oven/air fryer is going to be absolutely marvelous together. Thank you for this app and thank you for continuing to update it.",10/14/21 13:28,5

Be My Eyes,"I have been a volunteer with Be My Eyes since 2019. It makes me so happy to help people! The app requires an Internet connection.

Sometimes I check ingredients to be sure a pet doesn't eat something they are allergic to. Other times I help be sure a person doesn't raise the heat too high on a hotel oven. 

These actions, simple for sighted people, are so taken for granted! Then there are the times when a glucose meter can't be read or when spots in an unfamiliar bathroom might be confused for bugs. The world can be a scary place. This app makes it safer, but be sure to follow the call rules.

Be My Eyes is an essential new tool for sight challenged people around the world. It's free. It makes lives easier and better one call connection at a time.  And it reminds us volunteers the importance of humility and self sufficiency. Thank you for this amazing app!!!",03/01/25 5:35,5

Seeing AI,"Before now, all problems that I had run into seemed to be fixed, but now, I ran into an issue with a wrong product. I was looking for my members Mark onion powder, and instead of telling me that it was onion powder, it told me that it was GV thin spaghetti. I obviously knew that was not thin spaghetti, and decided to start opening packages to see what they were so that I could find the right thing. It turned out that what it told me was spaghetti, was the onion powder that I was looking for. it's fortunate for everybody in my household that I'm not the one with the cold that I was making soup for, or we could've ended up with something really off the wall in the soup because I wouldn't have been able to smell it. The problem is, when we run into a problem like this, there's no button to report a problem, so it's going to start telling everybody that members mark onion powder is great value thin spaghetti, which if you shake it, it's obviously not, and it's not even in a container that thin spaghetti would be in, but for somebody who has never cooked, or is just learning, they won't know that it's the wrong kind of package. Spaghetti is typically in cellophane or cardboard, and this giant thing of onion powder is a plastic container. This is something that we need. We need to be able to report a wrong product if it's telling us that it's one thing, when it isn't. I have known older people who store everything in the same place, whether it's edible or not, if it's kitchen related, it goes in the cupboard, regardless. I have known people who have stored rat poison in the same cupboard as spices because it's too high for kids to get into, and I would really hate for somebody to put rat poison in their food by accident because this app told them that it was something edible. I'm not one of these people, and don't even keep rat poison in my house, but unfortunately, I know people who do. I could see this being a deadly mistake if we don't have a place to report wrong product uPC's. also, in one developer response to somebody, it says go to seeingai.com to see improvements in the app, but that just takes us right back here to the App Store.",09/30/23 23:40,4

Be My Eyes,"Volunteer review, so take it with a grain of salt. The app notification makes it very easy to answer calls when I am able to. I've had the app for a few years and have had the privilege of answering 5 calls so far. You simply answer the call and you see the video from the caller. Using their device, they can show you what it is they are needing help with. Using your microphone, you work as a team to help navigate whatever it might be. Every caller has been lovely! What a wonderful app!",09/22/22 18:14,5

Be My Eyes,"I just had my 1st phone call and it was a beautiful interaction! We got to chatting after I assisted her and I asked if I could be her go to person and she said that the app doesn’t allow that. It just randomly picks who it calls. If that is not the case, I would love to know how to tell the next person that I bond with, that there is a way to do that. If that isn’t a thin, I was wondering if on the next upgrade you folks could maybe make that possible? Could someone choose us as a favorite to call? Maybe put a heart next to our name or something of the sort? I’m still giving it five stars Because I think this is a beautiful and app but that would be such an added bonus.

Be My Eyes,"I love the idea of this app and see that a lot of people use it to help others, but I deleted it as I received maybe a call or two over the course of several months and most of the time, the call was supposedly answered as soon as I answered.

Seeing AI,I recently became blind. Your application has allowed me to be able to read my mail and read products that I have at home on my shelves and  allowed me to pay the taxi driver using your money identifier without fear of being ripped off. I would like to see the barcode scanner improved with more product availability. A lot of times it just says no description available. I would love to see this app available on the Mac so that I can scan my mail using my scanner. Just a thought :-),06/24/21 5:59,5

Be My Eyes,"Excellent app. I feel it is one or two small adjustments away from greatness. The UI for sighted people can be a bit confusing and the points system seems slightly odd but I understand it is there not as a game but to rate users. The hardest part is the fact that I have answered a bunch of calls but usually am beaten to it by someone else who helps faster than me. This is a great problem to have, but can be a bit frustrating. Overall though this app is excellent.",03/04/15 21:35,5

I didn’t have the camera lined up quite right, but she helped me adjust it.  It only took a minute or so, but it was a big help to me!  It’s nice not to have to “bother” friends and family for help so much.  Thank you for this great app!!!",04/02/20 2:03,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I teach O&M to school-aged students, and I can no longer offer this app to them since they’d need to pay. Monthly. The app honestly did not work consistently even before the subscription model. Now, seeing other reviews that the app still does not work even after paying for it, it’s sad to realize the makers are just trying to get money from a community that wants to increase accessibility for crossing the dang street. Messed. Up.",03/03/25 17:07,1
Be My Eyes,"In 45 seconds, I helped someone choose between options during a life-activity. It was a fantastic experience and a wonderful way to USE tech to BE human! This is a mutually rewarding, and heartwarming, quick-fix! I love this app! THANK YOU BME, for making it!",03/09/19 21:58,5

Seeing AI,"Love this app so much. I like how it has so many different uses all in one app. I hate when I have to download a bunch of apps that I don't even know will work, but this one does work for sure. I still can't find my money reader, so I just use the currency preview mode. Thank you guys for thinking of us and our community!",05/23/18 23:45,5

Be My Eyes,Camera quality is terrible and there seems to be significant lag. The people I've answered calls for have been able to eventually figure things out together. My biggest thing now is there is no way to allow the app the make notifications on my phone. I never changed the settings. I went to allow notifications and it wasn't even an option anymore.,09/07/23 11:15,1
Be My Eyes,"Awesome service! I tried this out with my blind friend. She was thrilled how easy it was to use from her smart phone, wirh ""voice over"" comnands. I had someone read fine print on a cleaning product (I couldn't read it, even wirh my glasses), my blind friend got help telling the difference between two similar shaped travel-sive squeeze bottles of toiletries. We were both very impressed!",08/25/19 12:19,5

Be My Eyes,"video quality errors, the callers should be able to capture what's on their screen as it gets complicated for the volunteers to read small captcha texts or even distinguish between colours, please add a feature that notifies callers to clean their camera lense before placing the call, still most of the issue is network related.",03/31/23 23:51,5
Be My Eyes,"I've only answered one call. It was very simple. A package to the wrong house, they wanted help reading the name. Took less than 5 minutes. The visual quality of the video was disappointing. Since that's the most important part, it was not easy to read lines of text coming through but we got it done. Better video quality is a must.",09/24/20 8:17,4

Be My Eyes,I just answered my first call as a volunteer. I helped read greeting cards for the person so she could pick one appropriate to send for people moving.

BlindSquare,I really enjoy using this app. It has  enabled me  to become more independent. I use this app simultaneously with Google maps for the turn by turn directions and it is very helpful.

Hopefully others can find good in this as well!",01/01/23 19:06,5

Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that a couple of calls had video issues.

In all, however, I love the idea of the app.

Supersense - AI for Blind,"A good app and it’s priced for $49. It does a lot of the things that it’s competition does but in some aspects it does them better. I found the barcode section of the app very usable especially in grocery stores. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app once but it seems to be working like a charm. The app is quick fast and intuitive I have run it on an iPhone XS max as well as an iPhone 12 pro. Maybe as the developer said the state will reimburse me for the price of the app. I could not get myself to pull the trigger for $99, it was just too much money but because of the holiday sale I purchased it for $49. We will see if the price is worth it if the developers keep iterating on the app with new improvements. I know they’re free apps out there that do the same but I’m from the old-school, you get what you pay for. The best feature that this app or anyone can come out with is that the app would be able to read a touchscreen display such as on a laundry machine or vending machine, that’s the function everybody wants. I think a company that can make it happened will excite the entire visually impaired community.",12/31/20 11:28,4

Be My Eyes,"I have been a member about 6 months. I was the first to answer a call for the first time about a month ago. That gentleman was new to the app and just wanted to try it out and ask some questions. Today I received a call where a woman had three pairs of tights, and needed to know which were blue, brown, and black. It was easy to help her and she seemed very grateful. 

As someone with RP but who still has very functional vision, it is so rewarding to be able to offer assistance. I have seen negative reviews from others that were frustrated they rarely got calls, and were never the first to answer. It was five months before I was actually able to help someone, so just stick with it. I think it is also helpful to remember this isn't about you, it's about the person that needs assistance. Basically you have nothing to lose by being a member, and eventually will be able to assist someone. I am glad there are services like this out there for me when I need help someday.",10/21/17 17:45,5
Be My Eyes,"This app caused so many ads on my phone. They'd randomly pop up even when I

Most of the time we don't need the camera light. on or off we can adjust the light then it will be best to use 2.

When I do this the fonts get larger but they write over themselves so cannot be actually read. So you can’t use there actual large print! You have to put it on smaller size. 

I thought it might be dynamic fonts interfering so I turned them off for the app and nope it’s just that poorly made. 

Whilst elements of it are useful I wish there was a better way to search for locations. It’s hard to plan a route to the location if it’s not listed.",03/28/25 7:18,3

I grew up helping my grandmother the way the visually impaired need help through this app.  I wish this was around when my grandmother was alive.  It makes me feel good to know I can be the eyes for those who live in darkness or cannot see well enough to do even simply tasks.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with emotion when I help someone through this app.  This makes me sad but also so happy that I can help others, and so easily.  I don’t even need to leave my home.

Be My Eyes,"Isn’t it amazing to be able to see what color socks you will put on in the morning? They are some people that don’t have that luxury, we as a human race know how to share with one another. The ability to help one another is embedded in all of us. The kindest gesture to help a person in need, is to be able to give them your time. Just a few moments to ease the persons mind in this time of struggle. I don’t have the resources to be able to fund $1 million project but I have the ability to help a person choose a color shirt, the correct socks for the day or night, and maybe your thermostat isn’t working and you can’t remember whether it’s on hot or cold. There is many of us that will be awaiting a call no matter the time no matter the situation. It all starts with one little change, being compassionate to one another can go along way.",02/02/20 15:37,5

When someone needs help the call comes in as a notification and connects to the other person ONLY if you open the notification. It’s such an easy way to help. The app is very easy to use and I highly recommend it. It feels great to help people and share a human connection.",10/07/18 15:34,5

OneStep Reader,"I have performed several scans that included different types of materials and conditions. I will tell you that no other app I have used even comes close to producing the results of the knfbReader app. I have used Prizmo, which is the only other app that comes close. Yes, the knfbReader app was designed with the visually impaired or blind person in mind and that despite what some will say is its strength. I do not believe this app costs $99.99 just to overcharge a certain segment of the population, the “blind tax,” but instead is a high-quality app that delivers on the features and performance promised. I could say quite a lot, but it really comes down to one thing and that is for you to decide if you want to work hard or work smart. Yes, you can pay less for apps that will do the job, but these other apps require a lot more fiddling to find the best position for extracting enough legible text to figure out what you got. People have used stands of all types to get the job done. With the knfbReader app you do not really need any stands etc. If you have one it will certainly help and especially when doing batches of image captures using the automatic mode. Otherwise, you can simply hold your device about eight to 10 inches above the material and nearly instantaneously get your results. I have absolutely no regrets paying $99.99 for an app that meets a need and I can remove all other apps. BTW, when I figure the cost of apps and a couple of stands I have purchased in trying to find a good solution I probably spent more than the cost of the knfbReader app. :)",09/19/14 19:17,5

Be My Eyes,"The creator of this app deserves a pat on the back for coming up with this idea👏🏻! I love the concept of being able to help a person/people just for the sake of being nice and wanting to help ☺️. If you’ve downloaded this app but haven’t yet received a call don’t worry there’s nothing wrong with you as a helper or your app just know there are a whole LOT of people who are willing to help so the “operator” might not have gotten to you just yet, so please be patient. In my opinion I personally think this so is simply brilliant!! (I’m sure I’m not alone in my sentiment)",04/27/22 18:29,5

At first, I was apprehensive if I'd really be able to help and not, well, screw things up. But after answering a few calls, I've found that my worries were unfounded. The tasks were fairly simple. It was a satisfying experience. Kudos to the people that made this app. You all have my respect.",07/14/21 1:47,5
Be My Eyes,"The creation of app is good initiative for helping blind, As a visually impaired student I have a suggestion: vh student generally need volunteers as scribers for preparing or writing assignments or exams and some time for reading. show a section for the purpose in the app could be created. Through the app the developer could try to connect the blind person and the volunteer who are ready to help academicAly, in the same city or otherwise",12/29/19 0:57,4

OneStep Reader,"This is an incredibly powerful, accurate and user-friendly app. I have used Claro-read on my PC for several years and this is definitely up there with it in the quality stakes. The great advantage is that I can dip in and out of books and skim read like other students, without having to scan entire chapters as PDFs first. You can even use it in the library with a pair of headphones. Stunning. The only thing I would improve is the functionality for saving documents you have just scanned/red, which I haven’t got my head round yet. (48 hours after downloading, still head over heels in the honey moon!)",11/28/18 12:50,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app! Ive only had 5 or 6 successful calls in 2 years but with 5mil volunteers thats to be expected. The reason i give 4 instead of 5 stars is because ive received 1 or 2 calls that wouldn't connect for some reason and therefore i couldnt help those people. Other than that i love this app and think its a fantastic way of helping out the blind community- being able to make a small difference to someone's day is nice :),10/22/21 13:34,4

I am really sorry you guys are upset that you haven't gotten a call, but that doesn't make this app ""pointless"". ugh, it is helping so many non or partially sighted people.

Be My Eyes,"I want to love this app; as a wheelchaired person myself, I wanted to help. But I have legal training and I have read a lot of Terms of Service—this one is using the need of its users (and probably hoping few people will actually read the TOS) to exploit the blind and low-sighted since they have their backs to the wall. The company retains full control of all content with the option to publish it as an ad, and your data will persist even if you delete your account. There’s vague wording about having your account terminated if you change the appearance of the app or website, but since they have full rights to interpret the TOS, that can include visual aids. There’s a lot more but you get the idea. I’m dismayed and disappointed that a blind person would do this to his fellow blind persons.",01/24/20 14:03,2

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded the app as a volunteer yesterday after seeing Molly Burke mention it. I had my first call today and it was straightforward to answer, although it took a few seconds to connect, and the audio and video was good with no connection issues. I like that the video link is one-way so you don’t have to worry about what you might look like if anyone can see you on the other end. It also double-checks that you want to end the call which is a nice touch so that you don’t accidentally get disconnected.",02/15/21 8:08,5
Be My Eyes,"Absolutely fantastic idea and execution to help visually impaired folks. Take the time and donate a few minutes to answer a call for someone trying to figure something out. Whether it be sorting canned food, logging into their computer, asking which milk is expired, use your power of vision to help those in need. Every call I’ve answered has been some of the most wholesome conversations.

With the recent release of the B, my AI, the artificial intelligence feature, I was very excited to get descriptions in any situation! And, it does a great job… As long as there are no people in the photo!
Recently I asked it to describe a photo where My Wife was sitting on a slide on an old time rocket ship in a children’s playground. The AI refused!
There are other apps that will do it, seeing AI from Microsoft will do it, the basic descriptions in my iPhone will describe it. They don’t do a good job, but at least they tell me there’s a person sitting on a slide. So be my eyes needs to drop this fear of describing photos with people in them, and update the application so that blind people can get true descriptions of everything in the world around us even people!",09/18/23 18:52,1

Lookout - Assisted vision,Nice app... But kindly add automatic language detection feature intext or document mode and also add PDF reading support and colour recognition,03/04/22 21:40,4
Envision AI,"Is there no choice of voices? 

This definitely works, but the pronunciation is so far off for some words it’s as if the app doesn’t recognise the word. Also, it’s reading more of the document than is shown on my screen, making it very difficult to know where to point the camera. And it reads out the punctuation which just renders the document incomprehensible. 

So it gets 2 stars - works, is easy to use. 
But voice is terrible, hearing the punctuation is nonsense unless I wanted to write an accurate copy of what is being read to me (and why would I?). Not being able to tell where it’s about to start reading, when it’s reading off the screen, isn’t at all useful.",11/01/24 0:13,2

Be My Eyes,"I would love to give this app, a higher rating and I would have except that it’s recent behavior is frustrating. I use the app mainly for reading mail. Occasionally, it will tell me that it can’t read the recipients name or address, because it is not supposed to disclose information from an image. To me, that kind of defeats, the purpose of using the app for reading mail as a blind person. yet, other times, it will read the mail, including giving me the name and recipients address. So the inconsistent application of this rule is confusing. But ultimately, the real frustration is that it applies this rule in the first place, meaning that I can’t always use this app, because I have to switch to another app to read the image. In  other respects, though, Be My Eyes is wonderful at describing images and scenes. when I sent a message about being frustrated, with the fact that it wouldn’t disclose this information, it responded that I could cover the personal information with the piece of paper and that way it wouldn’t reveal such information. This implied then that it would reveal all the information if I didn’t cover the page, but that wasn’t the case. since this behavior just started in the last month, I’m presuming that it might be a response related to how the European Union wants Apple to handle images. So, this is why I’ve rated the app reluctantly as a three star rating.",03/07/24 19:13,3
Be My Eyes,"I shouldn’t encourage others to join since it might decrease my chances to get a call. However, helping individuals with low vision makes me so happy, I can’t help it.

Envision AI,this is a very helpful app,09/07/22 2:45,5
Be My Eyes,"I like Be My Eyes. It has been very helpful for me to have volunteers that read things for me. However, I used it this morning to read a prescription label. It did not read the prescription that was in front of me. It seems to be holding onto memories of reading a previous prescription. It’s very dangerous to have this app telling me. I’m taking one medication when I’m actually taking another. I don’t know what the deal is, but there’s no chance that it mistakenly read the wrong thing. The prescription at red was not even in the open. It was in a box. This is dangerous if you plan on it, keeping you safe.",03/02/25 14:28,3
Be My Eyes,"Good but doesn't allow me to overlay another app. Sometimes you need to Google stuff to help the other party, but the app disconnects the call when you change apps.",03/26/25 17:11,4
Be My Eyes,"I am so grateful to be my eyes, especially today. Somehow, I didn’t feel that my washing machine sounded right. I contacted be my eyes, and it seems it was on a 90 wash. We put the matter right, and the volunteer was so patient. Now, ther is no shrunken washing! Also, last week, we had friends come to visit, and I wanted to look for something, and my volunteer offered to help with the fridge. So many occasions have I had reason to be grateful, also, it’s like a friend dropping in. Thank you, Mrs Gail Nichol.",10/29/17 4:38,5
Be My Eyes,"don't call it ""giving back"" if you're sighted... let's set the bar higher on being a good person: you may only ever get one >2 min call a month so this is less effort than giving someone directions on the street. there's almost no reason BYM shouldn't be included as a built-in accessibility option on android and iOS.",03/28/19 17:24,5
Be My Eyes,I just received a call today and the experience wasn't a good one. I felt bad I couldn't help out the lady. The sound wasn't clear and the call ended without me finishing up with her.,01/26/22 2:46,1
Envision AI,Bengali ocr should be more developed.,11/06/19 20:27,5
Be My Eyes,I don’t get to answer every call but for the ones I do I’m happy to help. For me it’s a little part of my day but I’m sure it saves a lot of time for the people I get to assist to have this app. I recommend everyone download this app!,05/18/24 0:58,5
Envision AI,How should I pay for the app my credit card failed,10/11/21 1:56,1
Be My Eyes,I love the concept of the app but its impossible to answer a call. The answer button never works.,05/10/23 7:01,3
Seeing AI,Thank you it works now this is a great App,10/05/21 16:29,5
Seeing AI,I’m ready to choose this app over pricey KNFB Reader,10/21/19 3:00,5
Be My Eyes,"Quite likely the number one most helpful smart phone app to me as a blind man. I have been able to do my own laundry, distinguish food in the pantry, label vitamins and herbs, get my computer talking again when it had frozen,  and even assemble a mini greenhouse through the help of their awesome volunteers!! Would recommend to anyone😸",07/11/18 11:27,5
Seeing AI,"I literally fell in love with this app, how quickly it computes and reads off information and words in real-time... The creators of this app should be really proud of themselves. The one problem I have with this is the cancel ""x"" buttons. I'm not blind, but I found it hard to hit the ""x"" button. I feel like there could be a bother or better option to cancel the photo by, say, shaking the phone, double-tapping, etc. I think this app will go a long way!",07/12/17 20:03,5
Be My Eyes,It's a great initiative team. This is really gonna help them. Keep up the good work. GBU 🙏,04/24/23 9:44,5
Envision AI,I am very disappointed that I cannot get my updates that I paid for,02/27/24 12:50,3
Be My Eyes,"I never review apps, but this one is pretty amazing. To be able to answer a simple question immediately to a person who is blind or has low vision, is unbelievable. If you’re busy when you get a call, there’s a dozen other people waiting to answer, it’s first come, first serve, no worries.",01/25/20 16:05,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing. Restores faith in humanity a bit.,07/14/18 11:40,5
OneStep Reader,Don't waste your time and especially your money! I would rate this app with zero stars if Google would allow it. I couldn't even evaluate this piece of crAPP. As a low vision user I have to say there are much more effective (and FREE) apps out there like Supersense. Supersense is extremely good at reading any amount of text without charge!,04/16/20 16:48,1
Be My Eyes,"This is a wonderful idea. I'll never remove this app. The only suggestion I have is it would be good to be able to set active hours as a sighted person. I have to turn notifications off when i go to bed, but may not remember to turn them back on when i get up. If you could set active hours it would be perfect. Also my phone is on silent 95% of the time. I'd love to be able to set this app to still ring even when on silent. Otherwise this is an outstanding app, I'll be recommending to everyone",02/25/21 2:23,5
Be My Eyes,"I haven't received my first call yet, but the concept alone deserves 5 stars!",12/02/17 15:16,5
Be My Eyes,I get so excited when I receive a call from someone needing assistance. It brightens my whole week!!!,07/07/15 19:40,5
Be My Eyes,Such a great app. Can anyone recommend me a similar application,01/01/23 7:09,5
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,So far I am very happy with this app. I am visually impaired and I use this app and more more it amazes me of how accurate it is. I like the ability to even correct some of the directions in the system and I was pleasantly surprised that they are doing better with locations of things inside airports.,02/01/21 15:23,4
Be My Eyes,"Installed it, immediately got a request <3 then nothing ever again. Today I went in app and it wouldn't let me in just kept loading and loading. No updates were available in the store. I uninstalled and installed again to see if that'll help the issue",11/06/23 0:39,3
Seeing AI,Be my AI is better than Seeing AI because I was pushing the button where I could help me not to call volunteer but the one we were describes more not the one where it gives you different items. I don’t really like this app. It’s not very good. I wouldn’t recommend it.,10/05/24 0:27,3
OneStep Reader,why is it silent when i press play? more ui voice feedbadk needed. eg does it need network or it thinks i have free vers for example,07/14/19 0:58,3

Be My Eyes,"I have this app for more than 3 months but I never get any calls at all, I am very willing to help!

It's better if we can choose a music for easy notification and not the boring tone when getting a call just like the Test Call. I'm not sure if I need to have this app for a longer time or have it deleted? 🤔",10/30/15 8:57,1
Be My Eyes,Excellent concept. Works very well,06/07/22 0:27,5
Be My Eyes,Got my first call tonight and I was so glad to be of help to a man who needed me. As a person who sees we get so caught up in not realizing that we can do anything but a simple call that we answer really changes someone’s day! This app is really great!,07/21/19 3:41,5
Be My Eyes,Thank you to the creators of this app!,11/27/23 21:35,5
Be My Eyes,I had a girl get a hold of me and we were doing really good and all the sudden the phone cut off. I had no way of contacting her back. Can’t you put in even just a redial feature even if you don’t show the phone number?,04/14/19 21:30,4
Be My Eyes,"I haven't gotten a call yet. Admin says may take a week or two before I get a call, due to the fact that there are only oh-so-many people that need help, vs the 2 MILLION volunteers (a testament to humanity). Some apps make you wait hours, days, weeks before you can progress to ""the next level"". This is one app that... Well, I just don't mind waiting for. When my call comes, I'll be honored to help!",07/06/19 0:59,5

Envision AI,I just tried it today after it updated. I couldn't get it to scan anything when I had Wi-Fi and Network turned off. The App wants an internet connection. So does it work offline? To me the answer is NO. I tried the continues scan and document one. Neither one worked. Tried Hand written for grins. Again no GO. Turned Wi-Fi on so see if I could get it to read US money. Again no go. Didn't have any luck before the update on US money either.,12/12/18 17:18,1

Everyone at the small brewery where I work has now downloaded the app and they love it too!  Great idea, good execution, and I highly recommended being a sighted volunteer.",05/12/18 0:32,5
Be My Eyes,"Reading expiration dates on soup cans, denominations on dollar bills and reading laundromat machine screens is rewarding!",01/25/23 2:50,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing idea!! And seeing the ratio of volunteers to blind warmed my heart... in unity we survive,07/24/21 14:28,5
Be My Eyes,"A friend told me about this app because, as a teacher, he said I seemed like a good candidate to want to help others. 🤷🏻‍♀️😏 I am so thankful he did! I only wish I’d known about it sooner, and I wish I got more calls, honestly! This is a way I can help that constantly reminds me to stop and remember how blessed I am for the (albeit, very flawed) eyesight I do have, and to embrace all the things I am able to see each day, and all the tasks I am able to complete. Overall, I feel this is an amazing way technology has changed then world for the better. Thank you to the creators.",06/21/22 0:17,5
Be My Eyes,Glad I can help out visually impaired who need assistance by simply telling them what I’m looking at. Everyone has been friendly and kind,02/27/22 23:17,5
TapTapSee,This app is awesome sometimes it is so detailed it's like I can see I love it helps me get dressed in the morning and helps me recognize all kinds of canned goods and foods and tons of other items it's amazing even recognized and obscure product that my friend sold me from and on on line nature supply,02/29/16 11:29,5
Be My Eyes,Very helpful app. Volunteer Debojyoti Sarkar was very helpful and cooperative ❤️,02/21/25 21:47,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,Cool,09/03/20 18:30,5
Be My Eyes,I’ve been lucky to answer a few calls and help people with multiple things. Each time the person was very thankful for the assistance.,10/26/23 22:46,5
Be My Eyes,"Had not used the app in quite a while because of lengthy wait times. After recent updates, decided to try again when I needed help reading labels.  The request was answered in about 30 seconds; the person reading was friendly and read what I needed quickly and efficiently. The app works great, and I certainly plan on using it often now the wait time is so short.

Be My Eyes,What an amazing service. Thank you for the opportunity to help.,05/08/18 1:53,5
Be My Eyes,Awesome new interface. Used it for 2yrs or so. Been called on a few times for help. Once in a while you hear a ring and if u answer quick enough you help someone in need. This app is a no brainer to install. It’ll take a minute if your time and really have great input on someone’s life..,01/11/18 3:14,5
Be My Eyes,This is just sooo beautiful knowing that someone started this app and the thought of it and it’s amazing . I love it 🥰,07/03/19 1:43,5

Be My Eyes,So helpful with tasks from the simple to be more involved. Recently used the app to get the style of jeans I wanted to order from Amazon. I plan on using this for an upcoming trip to Japan with navigating the airport both home and abroad. Thanks for such a valuable app that works wonderfully!,07/02/18 15:07,5
Be My Eyes,Never got a call. This is useless.,01/22/15 6:34,1
Be My Eyes,Love helping when I can.,04/14/21 21:19,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Need some work but still helpful. Misidentifies common object and if it thinks it sees text it will read. Tip: Switching mode stops reading. It would be vastly better if it could recognize a hand and tell you what is close to your hand. Better than no help but searching for better options.,08/07/22 12:21,3
Be My Eyes,The concept is amazing and me and my kiddos were super excited to be able to help someone. When we got the call however the connection circle kept spinning and never connected. It hurts my heart knowing someone was calling for help and just left with no answer.,01/05/22 12:54,2
Be My Eyes,please add dark theme,08/09/23 15:36,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Works well but if you have your TTS set to another language it will play that language whenever you are on English in this app. Other languages will work normally when selected.,08/28/21 20:27,4
Be My Eyes,It won't let me help anyone,02/22/15 14:50,2
Be My Eyes,What a brilliant idea! Cant wait to use it or to be of help to others. Thank you for creating a way to give help freely and easily....,12/27/21 4:30,5

Be My Eyes,"The app is SO easy to use. When I get a notification for a call, I jump at the chance to answer. It’s so nice to be about to help and is a great expansion of your knowledge of how individuals cope with being sightless. Everyone that I’ve answered a call for has been so nice and appreciative.",04/14/21 14:53,5

Be My Eyes,Very simple app with a powerful impact. I'm pretty lucky to get my call after a day of signing up. Connectivity was great and I was able to help out the recipient.,03/18/22 21:18,5
Be My Eyes,"beautiful idea, it is super easy and helpful.",10/20/18 12:37,5
Be My Eyes,"Although I appreciate this service and have helped people with this app, I feel this app is lacking in the ability to choose the hours of availability making it limited to only some people who need assistance or are willing to offer assistance. For instance what is someone who is blind needs help outside of the 8am - 9pm times? What about people who work overnight hours and need assistance or want to be available to help someone during the night?",11/19/22 13:30,3

Be My Eyes,"I really like this app and the way it can help other people, but I found a very annoying problem that is with its connection stability. my last few attemps with this app wasn't successful and I couldn't be helpful, since it is keep disconnecting every time and it cannot manage any interference in the internet connection. I can see that the others had the same experience. I hope this problem will be solved as soon as possible. Thanks again for your idea, and your amazing app",05/06/22 4:17,3
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The OKO app was once an innovative and essential tool for blind and visually impaired individuals. Its core focus helping users cross streets safely with reliable AI was groundbreaking. It simplified a critical aspect of independent travel, and the five-star reviews from its earlier days reflect just how effective it was at meeting this need.

Unfortunately, as the app has expanded its feature set, it has lost sight of what made it great. While apps like GoodMaps Outdoors and VoiceVista excel in navigation, OKO now struggles to keep up in this space, becoming a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. The new features, while perhaps well-intentioned, dilute the app’s primary purpose and compromise its reliability.

Adding to this disappointment is the introduction of a subscription model. For a once simple and effective tool, the cost is unjustifiable, especially given its diminished value in comparison to free or more robust alternatives. It feels like an unnecessary expense for many in the visually impaired community, myself included.

I truly hope the developers reevaluate their approach and refocus on OKO’s original strengths. Until then, I cannot recommend this app as an essential, but more of a nice to have",01/22/25 1:51,3
Be My Eyes,"Such a wonderful idea, it gives an opportunity for the general public to be generous towards helping people in the blind community through the access and ease of today's modern technological advancements. It's an absolutely heartwarming app.",06/25/23 23:23,5

Otherwise to all other blind people out there dont waste a dime on supporting these folks who willl only take your money and provide a product that doesnt work. It might work for iphone, but iff youre interested in true inddependence dont llet NFBs obvious bias dictate to you what pllatfform to use. Hit them where it hurts dont buy!

I’ve helped a lovely American lady read which Artists she had download codes for, a polite and friendly Englishman with cooking instructions at Xmas, and just now, a lovely couple with best before dates on their drinks. 

This really is the best app on my phone, I feel so honoured each time I take a call. The people I’ve spoken to have thanked me but they’ve brightened my day so much by letting me be their eyes. 

Please recommend this app to anyone that may need it, and also to any volunteers that can assist. 

You may be waiting a while to answer a call but it’s so worth the wait.",03/11/20 13:22,5

This is because, they don’t work as expected and or the app crashes when I go to run it. At least the app crashes when I go to run these new features. This includes the world view as well as the indoor navigation view. Microsoft, you definitely need to fix this so that these features won’t crash out.",02/15/23 14:55,4

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,Your app is not workinh in rural area!,05/17/23 20:16,2
Be My Eyes,Its a good initiative and i appreciate for the work but i have a doubt that i am receiving 5-6 calls a day and every call is answered already by some other volunteers but yesterday i receive a call who is asking for captcha but due to video problem it disconnected after then i feel bad that i was not able help him but then i thought that if  that person is filling a form or something which requires captcha and if he is unable to write captcha then how he is able to fill the other details in that form or something. Is it a fake call to promote app only or it is real? I couldn't understand. I give it 5 star because of this initiative and logic behind app.but i don't know whether these calls are fake to promote app.anyway whatever it is if anyone need help i will help him.,10/09/17 11:31,5

From which visually impaired people are getting a lot of benefits. I am very grateful to you for this. I myself am a percent blind. And I am benefiting a lot from this application. In what is now the feature of AI. It is under-appreciated. Recently it has been further improved. I would like to give you some of my opinion in this reg,01/31/24 19:53,5
OneStep Reader,Not happy with its limits when competes with free apps that work better,04/30/19 12:55,1
Be My Eyes,"2 calls helping others in last few months, as soon as I pick up they hang up on me few moments later. Then a screen with a big thumbs up or thumbs down button appears. I've tried to choose thumbs down each time as the call didn't happen but it doesn't respond. I just tried about 50 times, nothing. But last time i tried thumbs up to see if it works either and it did. I guess that's one way to get overwhelming positive feedback! Support doesn't do anything either. Is it a scam app?",07/02/22 22:28,1
Be My Eyes,Very human idea. 👍 👍,06/15/18 7:15,5
Be My Eyes,It seems when I get a notification the ap is slow to respond to me opening it.,03/24/22 16:43,3
Seeing AI,"I am rating this app 5 stars just because I think it's just a great, much-needed app that I hope it meets the needs of the seeing impaired and that MS will continue to improve it.",07/12/17 7:33,5

Be My Eyes,"Just a quick phone call is very easy for me, but can really help and ease someone who is visually impaired. I have had two calls now and although both short I have really felt like I’ve made a small impact in someone’s life. The app works well, very easy to use.",11/30/24 10:51,5

Be My Eyes,i will use this application nw,01/18/19 3:04,3
Be My Eyes,"This is one of the only apps on my phone I am extremely happy to use and even happier after I have used it. 

By far the easiest way for one to give back and realize how lucky we all are and the things we take for granted. 

Kudos to the creators of the app.",03/07/23 16:53,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Not sharing,10/18/23 8:33,5
Be My Eyes,wonderful idea. But can't attend the call .,11/24/21 6:20,2
OneStep Reader,Started the app for the first time and it said I had zero recognitions left. Can't even test it and no obvious instructions available. Price is over 100 dollars which is probably reasonable but I can't test it.,08/24/19 11:52,1
Be My Eyes,The fact that they had this kind of idea already deserved a 5 star. I haven't used it yet but I'm looking forward to helping blind people.,01/05/21 20:07,5
TapTapSee,Love it,04/04/16 7:28,5
OneStep Reader,"This is a great app for the visually and pay her. My only issue with this app right now, is that when you select Martha page document it does not let you type multiple pages only the first page. Please fix this problem. Will write a five when you fix them up to page document selection. Thanks.",06/11/16 12:48,4
Be My Eyes,Please send me a text with your phone number on it. My phone is fixed so I can’t receive any calls from numbers that are not on my contact list.  But now I can’t get any calls for assistance. Thank you.,05/10/24 23:02,5
Be My Eyes,"Amazing idea. This is how tech should be used, I hope you guys can make it 
offline (color & text recognition) so that a person doesn't really needs to 
rely on others when he doesnt have an internet connection.",07/08/18 2:32,5
Be My Eyes,A great feeling helping out. It was so easy!,04/19/19 20:34,5
Be My Eyes,I love being nice and helpful; it makes me feel purposeful. The people I helped were so kind and appreciative. Both parties get off the phone smiling after the call :),07/30/23 19:36,5

Be My Eyes,"I got my first call for help and I was just so happy to help someone! I was a little nervous, but now, I am ready for more calls. Great idea-great app!",03/31/23 5:44,5
Be My Eyes,"Really incredible way to help someone in need. You get to connect with vision impaired people and assist them with tasks. it could be as simple as them crossing the street, wanting to sift through their mail, or check which button to press to switch on an aircon. I have always had great interactions there, and met lovely people.",09/26/23 13:25,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"The app is very helpful for us visually impaired people. I hope that soon, Philippine peso mode in the currency and in the barcode/food label area be included.",07/30/22 17:32,4
Be My Eyes,Very good idea for a app.,12/02/19 2:37,5
Be My Eyes,"I haven’t gotten to answer a call yet. I just signed up. But flipping through the app, I’ve watched a few stories. I’ve seen the stats. We have over 1 million volunteers and only 80,000 who might need help on occasion. I’m not going to be disappointed if I don’t get a call right away or even if I don’t get a call for a month! 
For those who wish there was a toggle, your account only gets called when your logged in (I read some info from the developer). If your going to bed, or going to be away/unavailable, log out. Log back in when your available or awake. 
Lastly, perverts are everywhere. I’ve gotten sexual messages and pictures (really gross) on Facebook messenger before. Just got to hang up and move on. 
I cannot wait to help my first person! ❤️❤️❤️",06/20/18 2:08,5
TapTapSee,This app is helpful and accurate when the picture of an object is taken Correctly. But sometimes I have to take the picture more than once in order to get the desired description. That is sometimes not convenient.,10/13/13 19:13,3
Envision AI,Expected better all round for the price.,01/12/22 7:44,1
Be My Eyes,"The bad video quality makes it really difficult to help when someone asks what color the object is. If a call gets disconnected, you cannot tell if the other person did it or it was network issues. You cannot return to the call if it was network issues. The idea is great, execution is lacking.",10/16/17 7:40,3
OneStep Reader,I was hoping that this most recent update would fix my issue where I was unable to open the app on my iPhone XR. Unfortunately it still does not open making this app completely unusable! I don’t understand why it will not open. It acts like it will open and then doesn’t.,04/29/21 11:04,1
Be My Eyes,Amazing opportunity to serve.,04/06/22 19:47,5
Be My Eyes,I CRY after ever call because I am so happy I can help! I've had it a couple years and have had at least 6-7 calls. This is so rewarding for a seeing person and helpful for a non seeing person ! Great app,03/15/23 18:26,5
Be My Eyes,"Love how much this can help people. I’ve sorted mail, helped get the correct sugar to put into coffee. It’s typically simple stuff to make their life a little bit easier.",03/22/22 11:30,5
Be My Eyes,"If you had two versions - exactly the same - but one was “99¢ donation to help us spread into the developing world” I’d have downloaded that one because; that’s a pretty easy way to help the backend of this app - without much hassle!
Thanks for making it.
I thought this kind of app up years ago but imagined it would be trusted white-collar crime prisoners trying to get early parole by being kind of a remote seeing eye dog for blind people walking outside - or reading to kids who had illiterate parents. 
(Have not used yet - saw the BBC article - can’t wait to do it as soon as I have a free hour or so :)",02/24/18 18:59,5
Seeing AI,"This app was great until recently. I used this app to scan money, scan products, and read text, but the recent updates have made it very terrible for me. You can no longer do money scanning on the app, and they took away the really short text feature, so now you have to take a picture of the document which is not easy for some people, even with the camera help. Seeing AI team, If you see this, please bring back the old features of the app.",03/14/25 21:19,2
Be My Eyes,I love being an active participant in helping someone.  This app is extremely user friendly and connects you while respecting your privacy. It’s a great way to give back and I’m grateful to have the opportunity.,04/23/19 1:40,5
Be My Eyes,"The sound is too low, no option to adjust volume or ringtone for faster response",12/24/22 22:40,1
Be My Eyes,Great just wish it had a dark theme for those of use who can't handle bright light,10/11/24 2:14,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,My friend was unsure about using this app so wanted me to test it for her it seems very good,06/21/21 3:28,5
Be My Eyes,Honestly the best app I’ve seen yet. I wish I would get more calls though. I’ve had the app for a year and I’ve only gotten a total of three calls. The first two weren’t answered quick enough although I immediately clicked accept. I was lucky to get through to someone yesterday & I keep thinking about it. I am so grateful to have been able to help a visually impaired person in need of help to check if someone was in her house. I ended up talking to her for a few minutes and realized we were state neighbors. It truly made my heart happy and made me want to do this more. SEND US MORE CALLS!!! Some of us LOVE it.,04/27/22 20:56,5
Be My Eyes,"Don't even bother! I don't even know why they even let new volunteers sign 
up! They actually said to me might get one opportunity a month! I was 
hoping to help people not stare at my phone for a month!",06/09/18 5:47,1
Be My Eyes,"Let me start by saying, thank you to be my eyes Developers for giving Android users the ability to see too.

Be My Eyes,Excellent idea. Well done to the creators for this app. More blind/ vision impaired people should be aware of this app and hopefully the creators can make a bigger awareness off this app in the blind/vision impaired community,03/25/23 6:08,5
Be My Eyes,I downloaded this app after seeing a post about it on Facebook. I was excited to help people that needed it but the home page will not load and I am very disappointed. Please fix it as soon as possible! I would love to help!,01/22/20 5:20,1

Be My Eyes,I joined at the end of October and have just had  my first call today. A lady needed me to read the labels on 4 packets so she knew what they were. It is a great feeling being able to help somebody who is visually impaired achieve what they’re trying to do.,12/04/22 5:28,5
Be My Eyes,"Tried to help someone yesterday, sadly I couldn't. They asked if I could search online for something, however when I did so they couldn't hear me anymore, I could hear them but they couldn't hear me and wasn't hearing what I was saying. They thought I'd hung up 🙁",05/21/21 11:08,3
Be My Eyes,"I joined in 2018/2019 and love using the app to help people, it is so rewarding, easy to use and Perfect for immediate assistance.

I used to have weeks between calls, but for some reason I haven't gotten any requests for a long while now.

Envision AI,Yes you're really amazing but try to make the exporting faster if you can,09/21/22 23:56,5
Be My Eyes,"I like the idea of this app. However, I am uncomfortable with their privacy policies. It seems like they want to collect a lot of personal information and they even say they will give your information to other organizations.

Be My Eyes,I think this app helps me with my condition.,02/06/25 22:30,5
Seeing AI,"Very good at doing so many things and a fun way to play around with image detection AI!  Barcode reader is the best one I've ever used. Face detection seems extremely well implemented, I was able to quickly take a nicely framed up selfie using the back camera and the audio cues from the app. It tells you the subject's gender, age, and mood.  And then there's the scene detection where you take a picture and it does its best to describe what it sees. It's not always accurate but it's usually pretty close, and sometimes it can come up with some interesting feedback. 

Everything feels VERY snappy, at least on my iPhone 7 Plus on my home WiFi. The voice is so responsive and quick that using the app feels almost futuristic at times. This is the main thing that differentiates this from things I've seen before. It feels a bit like an Apple product— none of these AI technologies is new, but it's the first time they are all together in one accessible place and so well executed. 

The only thing that didn't work for me was the document detection feature, I tried many times to scan a receipt on A4 paper from an online purchase and it appeared to recognize the geometry of the paper very well and quickly asked me to hold still but then said there wasn't any text found while displaying a black screen where there would normally be an image. Apparently a minor bug which I hope they'll hammer out in the next release. 

I truly believe this app will help many people with vision impairment. Thank you for your hard work on making something great!",07/13/17 3:21,5
Be My Eyes,FYI if you are in a snap call and answer a guy on this app the audio doesn't work and the person in need can't hear you.,11/08/22 3:22,3
Be My Eyes,"This is an update on my review, Until now I have only received one call that was the one which dropped... since then nothing. :( I just received a call from someone who most likely needed help but when I answered the call it didn't connect, and the call dropped. I have had the application installed for a while now... this was my first call. I really want to help... the 3 stars is for your great initiative... when I successful help someone using it I will increase your rating.",09/15/20 11:17,1
Seeing AI,Love this app. I lost my vision three years ago and was told that this app is very useful. I use it almost daily on the go in at home. Everything works pretty seamless except for the color reader which can be kind of an accurate at times. It would be amazing if you guys can add some thing that would be able to read digital clocks. Unfortunately a lot of my devices in my home have digital clocks like my stove my washing machine my thermostat etc. I do use a lot of smart devices in my home but some of them are not able to be hooked up to my smart devices. So it would be pretty cool if I could hold the phone in front of the stove to see what temperature the oven is on or how much time is left on the washing machine etc. Overall absolutely love this application. Keep up the good work,10/25/21 6:03,4
Be My Eyes,"In under a minute, I made a difference.  A stranger needed help, and I was there. Such a rewarding app!",01/05/22 22:07,5
Be My Eyes,"My blind uncle told me he used this app to help him. He recently passed away and it reminded me to install it, and I'm glad I did. I just helped someone with their dinner, they wanted to know what canned goods they had.

To think that without this app someone would have tried to make dinner and would have had to open cans at random. Now as I type this a blind man is eating the dinner he wanted to prepare, not eat what he accidentally opened.

Seeing AI,"Update: someone recently asked me about useful apps for the blind. I told them that seeing AI app was like the Swiss Army knife for blind people. I think that is the Best way to describe this app.
 I love several of the channels that this app provides. The product, document and short text are great. The document channel especially is great. I purchase another app a while back for $100 and this app works better. I love that I do not have to presss a button to take the picture. 
I found the person channel fun, but not very useful. I do not find the color channel accurate. I have better success with tap tap See for colors. I used the color channel on a white shirt and when it was on the sleeves it would say grey and on the front or back of the shirt it would say brown. 
The currency channel is just as good as the other apps  available It is very accurate.",11/09/18 17:02,5

Be My Eyes,I just signed up for the app and I am very happy to help. I would like to make a suggestion. Is there a way to set time restrictions on when you can help a caller (let's say I'm available or not available from 8am-8pm on Saturday) or do you just have to sign out and sign back in every time you are available? Is there a setting to indicate what language you speak? I look forward to the first call where I can help an individual.,02/25/17 15:46,4

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The app works great. However, it is UNACCEPTABLE to charge $50 when it was free last week. Charging that much for an app who’s user base has a %70 unemployment rate is unconscionable. Please fix this now!",10/30/24 17:47,3

OneStep Reader,"A stack trace shows the Java DRM library breaks the app everytime there is an OS update. Why on earth is it OS version dependent at all? Can't you verify my purchase of the app some other way? Maybe find a way that doesn't break every few months? It's always sad to see good software broken by bad DRM. You can do better! Sincerely, a paying customer.",10/18/19 18:17,1
TapTapSee,I have found several uses for TapTapSee. First it is spot on reconizing things around me.  Second it is able to read print on boxes and containers.  Third is probably my favorite one it acts as a color reader and it more accurent than many APPs that I paid for.  Keep up the good work. Wonderful APP.,05/13/13 16:38,5
Be My Eyes,"I absolutely love everything about this app! I just wish there was a chat feature to continue chatting or some way of being able to connect; if wanted by both parties. Also a way of connecting to some that might just be lonely & want a friend. I have helped three people on this app & when I tell you the days I have received those calls are days I will remember FOREVER! Three humans I would have never had the opportunity of meeting , let alone having the pleasure of helping! Absolutely incredible experience!! Wish I was able to get more calls!! 10 STARS IF YOU CAN ADD FEATURES!",12/16/23 21:23,5

Be My Eyes,This innovative app works well when someone needs assistance with visual tasks. I love the incorporation of the flashlight/torch as it allows the assistant to provide extra light when they seen it necessary. Wonderfully done! I highly recommend this app.,09/03/21 9:25,5
Be My Eyes,"this is a brilliant idea for an app! I think it is important that it is simple and straightforward so there is no confusions in the main objective is solely for helping somebody else, as opposed to apps that would bribe you with reward. excellent job on this app",07/02/19 10:57,5

Be My Eyes,"I just got to help someone find a couple cans of stewed tomatoes in their pantry! It was very quick, less than 30 seconds between getting the notifications and them having their tomatoes. My day is made! 😊

I've actually had this app for over a year and this is the first time I've gotten to ""be someone's eyes"". I hope that means other people are really quick to help, and not that most blind people who might need help don't know about the app.

This app is a really great idea, and it works! ❤️",05/16/17 21:03,5

Be My Eyes,I downloaded the app because I thought it was a cool idea.  Little did I know I’d get my first call within a couple of days.  I was so nervous when I saw it was a Be My Eyes call I almost couldnt answer!  😁. I had the opportunity to help a gentlemen with his dinner.  I felt so good afterwards.  I’ve had vision issues so I can understand both sides of how this works.  It’s easy to get started and there are tips and a video on how to be a volunteer.This is a fabulous idea and so glad I signed up!,05/12/23 13:07,5
Be My Eyes,"Already received two calls from people needing assistance. I'll be honest, 
it's such a fulfilling feeling knowing not only that you helped someone 
when they really needed it, but that by helping them you instill the 
confidence in them that there are always those willing to lend a hand. I 
will keep this app on every device I ever own, and promote it as long as my 
voice will allow. With all the games and stupid rinky-dink apps out there, 
it's infinitely rewarding to have one that actually and directly effects 
people who need help. All the kudos I have go to the developers.",04/23/18 13:46,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is truly amazing. I just answered my first call, and it was such an amazing experience. The woman was so kind, and being able to help her with something, even as small as whether or not she had the right seasoning mix, made me feel so good. Being able to help someone even in such a small way warms your heart.",01/27/20 20:26,5
Be My Eyes,"I have been a member of this app for a couple of years now… I’ve only been lucky enough to answer a handful of calls (as there’s so many amazing volunteers).

You won’t regret it.",06/15/22 19:06,5

But that made me think... Perhaps you could create other ""good deed"" apps! For example, for the deaf, the deaf blind, and for other people with disabilities. I would download and volunteer for all of them in a heartbeat! I hope that's something that'll one day be considered. Anyways, this app is lovely and makes me feel so good, as I hope it does with others! Small acts of kindness like this app allows are what lights up my day.",11/14/17 23:44,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I wanted something like this for a long time. Since I can’t see the crossing signals, I would typically use my Magnifier app to locate and magnify the signal so I can see it and then when it’s safe to cross now, this app picks up the signal well before I reach the curb and let me know what the current state of the crossing signal is when a single changes to walk, I am immediately notified and can proceed across the street as long as the camera can focus on the signal the application quickly communicates changes in the crossing signal.

THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE GAME CHANGER FOR TGE SAFETY OF BLIND AND LOW VISION USERE EVERY WHERE!!!!!!!

Thank you for defending this app.",05/05/23 2:34,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,I like that this app does one thing and does it very well.  It opens up fast and gives almost immediate feed back as to the status of the traffic signal.  It helps me confirm that my sense of the walk signal status is correct.,11/27/23 13:07,5

Seeing Eye GPS,"I'm not sure exactly what it is, but something about this particular subscription model bothers me. Part of it is the subscription price itself. I think this particular application would be more accessible to more users with a monthly subscription that would cost around $10 per month. That way, your bottom line is still the same without making accessibility cost prohibitive to blind Users.",07/17/13 21:59,3

Be My Eyes,"Samsung S22 Ultra, unable to turn on notifications. Prior app worked well.",09/06/23 19:42,1
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This app was recommended to me in August 2024 by my white cane trainer from the Virginia Department for the blind and visually impaired.  It seemed to provide a decent functionality for crosswalk walk/don’t walk signals.  I never got to test it in the challenging lighting conditions that gave me problems.  When I went to experiment with it to see if it could handle Austrian signals, I find that it has moved from being free to a SUBSCRIPTION model.  If the developer needed to make moat for development. they could have done a flat purchase price.  Instead they want to continually pick the pockets of blind and visually impaired people who already face much additional cost and inconvenience in life. Perhaps if the developers had stuck to the crosswalk capability, they wouldn’t be facing development costs for the additional bloat. The awards this app garner and many positive reviews came before their switch to SUBSCRIPTION and would not have been received with this model. Doubtless, based on other negative reviews, the developer will spend time and money on making a response, further increasing their “need” for a SUBSCRIPTION model.",02/24/25 9:13,1

OneStep Reader,"An app that started off promising, has become an utter disaster! Though it provided lots of features and good OCR quality that could have made life more accessible in general, the current state of the app has just become absolutely pathetic. Though it is a rather expensive app on Google Play, there seem to be no functional support team. Each time there is an Android update, the app becomes disfunctional. and though Android 10 has been around for a while, the KNFB Reader hasn't got around to making itself functional. the app doesn't even start on my Nokia 6.1 running latest Android. Even when it used to run, it was nolonger able to recognize shared images from WhatsApp or other apps. A seriously regrettable purchase I must say, an absolute waste!",03/02/20 14:00,1

Be My Eyes,"I think that the app is a great concept, when it works. I've only been able to answer one call and the call was super grainy. I could not help like I needed to. I had a call that I could not answer at all. The app froze as I was trying to send feedback on a recent call and when it finally started up again it chose the call experience was good and it was not.

Be My Eyes,I'm a visually impaired user of this app/ service.  I found it so delightful to observe that there are more people to volunteer rather than the beneficiaries which shows the potential of this app to become a catalyst in mainstreaming disability inclusion. The positive reviews of the sighted volunteers go onto show how much of a gratification they have gained through the interactions they've made with blind people with it.,12/28/17 12:38,5
TapTapSee,"Last night I turned my phone on to check the time, I still had my app pulled up on my screen and my camera started going haywire, it took like 30 or more pictures.

It did not recognise two different sets of neat handwriting, the large product download failed and it did not recognise most of the objects in explore mode when trying to navigate my home.

Be My Eyes,"I was finally able to answer a call in time to help somebody! Yay! Sometimes it’s tricky because there are so many volunteers willing to help out and answer their phone. 

I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to help a young lady distinguish various pie flavors from one another. It was funny because she put the ones she loved the best in a pile that she was going to have for her, and the ones she did not love in another pile for someone else. Ha ha. 

I love how there’s a system where there is a flashlight on the screen thst lights up the area on her phone. What’s fabulous experience! I would give it 10 stars if it were possible!

Be My Eyes,"Be my eyes is the best app ever created. I answered a call to a man who had dropped and lost an apple in his kitchen. I had to direct him to find it, which we did. How rewarding it felt to help someone who really needed help.. it really lifted my whole day and week to know you helped. Thank you",01/26/24 15:19,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve read the stories on the app and noticed a theme. People say “I was hesitant to use that app to ask for help” and the other people say “I love it when I get the chance to assist someone.” 
I totally identify with not wanting to ask for help. When I was younger I had my pride and thought I could do everything myself. Now that I’m a little older I realize it has nothing to do with pride. My time is valuable. If asking for help saves me grief and time then yo better believe I am asking for help. There are 17 volunteers to every low or no vision user, so don’t hesitate in asking for help. People volunteer because they want to. You’re not going to be bothering anybody. 
I got the app two weeks ago and am excitedly waiting for my first opportunity to help",07/28/18 0:04,5
Be My Eyes,Great way to help people or receive help,02/27/20 6:34,5
Be My Eyes,"The best app for the blind and visually impaired. The Be My AI feature is so useful for reading things like menus and text in general. The descriptions of scenes aren't as detailed as other apps but this app has so much more to it, and they finally added audio description to Be My AI, not sure why it took so long but it's great to have that for people who don't want a constant screen reader on their phone. The main feature is calling sighted volunteers which is such a brilliant idea. 5 stars!",02/17/25 15:40,5

OneStep Reader,This app has gotten much better and much more useful than it has been in the past and I like that. I look forward to seeing how much better this app will become.

Cash Reader for the Blind,If you download this it is not the full version. It will only read small denominations. In order to re-$20 bills and hire you have to purchase the full version. The free version constantly badgers you to upgrade.,01/03/22 23:10,3

I was getting calls at 3 and 4 am!!!!  Sadly had to delete the app because of this.

Supersense - AI for Blind,"The text reading is ok but limited navigational help & absolutely none for the bar code scan, you have to have a degree of sight to have any chance of knowing where to point the camera. Not all features are available to try  in the free version & to have the cheek to request payment to unlock all of these features is ridiculous when there are free & superior alternatives  on the market. May be fine for partially sighted but not for completely blind.",05/25/20 0:43,1

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,I've been playing with it for a while with the aim of finding a Soundscape alternative for blind. I find it better than Google Maps as it gives more audio clues. I've removed 1 star as it has problems working offline and another star as it is missing the 3D audio to give a more immersive experience.,05/28/24 6:38,3

while to get a call. When you do, it's all worth it",08/17/18 23:10,5
Be My Eyes,"What an absolutely amazing idea for an app. Have already made many of my friends and family download this app. And the fact that you rarely get a call (which many people seem to be complaining about) is actually a good thing. It means there are enough volunteers that no one seems burdened by having to take frequent calls, so I urge people not to delete it just because you haven't got a call.",07/03/19 20:47,5

TapTapSee,"For a free app, this one isn't bad. It recognized all that currency bills I presented it, and most of the various products. However, there should be a repeat feature. What if the person did not hear what was read the first time?
Also, under the about heading, there is no apparent text. At least voiceover does not see it. What is the point of having an about heading when there is no text present?
Aside from these things, this app is pretty neat. I hope it continues to be further developed, and it certainly has the potential to be extremely useful for those of us who are visually impaired.",01/17/13 20:19,3

But even if it's 1 call a year, I'm never getting rid of this app.",03/05/25 7:26,4

I grew up with a sister who was visually impaired and I can't say I was the nicest to her growing up; but I have seen the difficulties she has endured; After hearing about this app, I downloaded it to see if I could truly help others. As of today, I've helped 2 people with a task and a question; and it gives me a good feeling knowing that I am helping someone get thru their day! I have recommended this app to all my friends and family; in hopes to have even more help for the visually impaired! Awesome app!",10/23/15 18:31,5

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,When using the app while walking the feet is like 900 feet or foot instead of going into feet he told me my house was still 100 foot of her head to me and didn’t even tell me when I needed to turn. Not sure if there’s a glitch in the app the app used to work pretty good some states do not offer people to teach your own Owen M skills anymore.

Even though I haven't received any calls yet it still makes my heart lighter and happier thinking that someday I will be of use to some people ... thinking that someone will be glad that I was there. thank you so much for making this aap 😊,05/14/19 13:45,5
Be My Eyes,I have had the great pleasure of helping people with this app on three occasions. It was a wonderful experience. I haven’t gotten a request for quite some time and miss it. Hope someone needs help soon. Thank you Be My Eyes.,04/03/23 19:26,5

Seeing AI,The short text reader is very quick and mostly accurate. Great for on the fly reading of bottles lotions and things like that. The document reader is very cool. You just hold it over the document and wait for it to take the picture as you were just. The other tabs did some work that’s why I only gave it a four star rating. It’s nice that when the document is processed it even keeps most of the formatting. KNFB reader does not do that. It just runs everything together. Very nice product. I wonder how long it will be free?,07/20/18 8:26,4
Be My Eyes,Absolutely amazing experiences every time....I'm thankful to be able to help be someone's pair of eyes when they need it,01/31/23 10:27,5

does anyone know if the same type of app exists for hearing?  so far the apps i have found are for automatic transcriptions, but if people could actually ""hear"" for others, nuances can be identified, such as ""what is this vibration?""  ""is this machine making the correct sound?""  ""is anything beeping in my house?""  ""are there any warning sounds right now?""  ""is my dog barking outside?"" ""are the birds singing?""

easy. The lady had a box of cheddar potatoes and needed to know what the 
box was and asked me to read the directions. Other than a few times asking 
her to move the phone right or left it was very easy and took less than 10 
minutes. My grandfather was blind so this helps me give back. I love the

cure cancer, but hearing her laugh and say ""thank you!"" when we got to the

Be My Eyes,This app is an absolutely outstanding app. I am totally blind and using screen readers. Are used both the android system and the iOS system. This app is a most excellent way to receive help on your devices and also the app has the ability to reach other volunteers who can help me with operating my dishwasher printer and other devices. I am so thrilled with this wonderful app.,09/30/21 21:57,5
Be My Eyes,the idea is great and I think in my humble opinion that contribution of something like Facebook to that great startup would make it perfect especially that Mark Zuckerberg has color blindness may God bless you all 😊,12/30/19 22:10,5
OneStep Reader,Since the last update it has been constantly crashing. I can do a field of you report and then when I go to take the picture it exits out of the app every single time.The only way I can get it to work is just by taking a picture without the field of view report which obviously doesn't work very well,09/05/15 15:19,1

Be My Eyes,"my disability has been exported against me how many using the service for several years and it's been very good never had a problem. I use it many times during the day however, yesterday I'm on the phone with Bankofamerica trying to resolve a dispute a claim I haven't use that account for a couple years, so I'm really happy but finally getting things resolved the bank literally forced me to identify myself with my debit card so I can't be my eyes. I just need to confirm the last four digits of the card. However, this gentleman wants to take a picture is that were speaking with him and he's telling me he's such a good person, she's really trustworthy. She said everything in the book what he was doing was buying time during that time that I was talking to him. He said nine transactions to cash app I got the emails are the freight other I called back the bank had to lock it and had them send me a new card. I reported this to be my eyes, they didn't respond. They suspended my account for how long I don't know. They said I violated their policies so now I'm literally in the dark without Aiden support, especially from the my eyes I have a gentleman's name and other information on him, but it would be my eyes do not ask me for his information so what that means is that this gentleman is a predator and he's going to pray on peoples disabilities. It's our fault for asking for help. It just shows more bias and discrimination that these volunteers can be predators and there's no protection and or assistance or support from be my eyes, I hope this letter comes out clear I'm speaking into the computer. Sorry for any misspelled words. I'm just very sad I should not be punished for asking for help. I should not be suspended because I reported in violation that backfired on me so now that this gentleman knows he can get away with it. They're going to create more volunteers so they can scan to disable, so be careful if your vision impaired people are new and they you",06/10/23 14:36,1

If a person who is not an expert answers the call it will be of no news. Even I received a call from a blind lady to help her identify the best matching pant for a top, I am not at all good in such things. So it would be good if only a subset of volunteers with required strengths receive the help request.",05/06/21 7:07,5

None of these things took more than a few minutes.after an interaction using the app, I’m always left with a sense of wonder at the ease of use, straightforward solution provided by the app, and it’s ability to help us help each other.

I asked her what it was and she said it was like a camera that tells you what you just took a picture of. It's amazing. I really like the app. Sometimes, when I'm on my tablet and when I don't know what the picture shows, I take a picture of that and tap tap see gives me a pretty good description. My grandmother was amazed that it too! Overall I think this is a very good app. I enjoy it a lot.",04/23/17 9:02,5

Be My Eyes,This is the best app ever. But I wish it could be possible to have a call back option.

Be My Eyes,"Great idea, but I told my blind friends about it and it turns out they would have to pay to access the app. I have an Android and I'm guessing they are using iPhones. The blind should be exempt from the fee. I don't want to use it if they are not.",01/17/20 19:59,1

Be My Eyes,"I just had my first call with an absolutely lovely young lady who needed help with her thermostat and reading the instructions on a food item she wanted to heat. I was honestly just so happy to have finally received a call and I hope that I was thorough in helping her. She was so sweet and fun to talk to as well, which is just an added bonus!

I wish I had remembered the ‘screen shot’ feature sooner in the call (ahh!) because it is a total game changer. Hopefully I have a second call now that I’m familiar with the platform.

So, New volunteers, here are a few tips if you’re feeling unsure:
-  dont forget the ‘screenshot’, ‘torch’ and being able to background the app (useful to look something up via the browser on your phone during the call if needed) 
- Make sure that after you both complete the task(s) at hand, you ask again if they need help with anything else (possibly a continuation of what the call was about i.e. I wish I would have asked if she needed help with actually preparing the food item after I read her the heating instructions for it, without overstepping).    

The interface of Be My Eyes is next level, top notch, A grade…and that’s an understatement.

In closing, this short interaction did just as much for me (if not more) than it did for her. Thank you for giving me the chance to make someone’s life a little easier (I hope! 😄). 

Best App, ever. <3",07/09/21 1:56,5

I am hoping they can improve the digital quality of their calls (it is afree app so its dependent on donations *Fingers crossed*) as a person in need asked me check to the quality of their cooked meat & the video call was alittle to pixelated.  But given the temperature they cooked at for the amount of time they cooked at their meal was safe.

people. 🙂",06/01/18 14:53,5
Be My Eyes,I've had this app for 2 weeks now and only helped 1 person!! Kinda wish I could help more people!! And I can't add a profile picture for some reason.,01/25/15 5:33,4
Be My Eyes,"Excellent idea, terrible implementation. This app makes more connection attempts than probably the 10 random apps combined. Even before doing anything with it, and without running it, it's CONSTANTLY trying to contact Facebook & Google & who knows what else. It has 6 trackers encoded , so it seems it just clickbait for people who want to help others, instead of helping they mine your data.uninstall it and be vigilant.Privacy allways matters.",08/09/20 11:16,1
VoiceVista,"Soundscape is now renamed and even better than before! Geoff has gone above and beyond in reorganising the display to make everything more clear and easily understood. Lots of options with beacons and markers, breadcrumb root, lots of granular settings for those who become more familiar and want to do more things with their settings. As with any app, it takes quite awhile to get used to it and find your way around when you use VoiceOver. However, stick with it it's worth the effort and you will be rewarded for your efforts.",01/20/24 6:41,5

Be My Eyes,"Well, I've been a ""promising helper"" for over 3 weeks now. I just got my first ""help request"" which turned out to be another helper, so this app definitely needs some corrections. Still waiting to actually help someone in need. Maybe you should have an application process, helpers have to meet a certain standard.",02/12/15 15:40,1
Seeing AI,"Amazing! So much potential to improve the lives of countless individuals. There's just so much going on here. I LOVE the way it takes what I see as an ugly depressing scene and describes it in such a beautiful way. It's like the AI sees the physical world in its most true, raw, natural form, without the painful memories, without the longing, without the bias and the negativity. It just SEES everything how I wish I could see it. This is helping me be a more positive person! So much potential❤️‍🩹",02/14/24 18:23,3

Be My Eyes,"I’ve helped someone set the right temperature on their oven; determine what color the shirt on the hanger was, and provide movie start times from a video screen that weren’t audible. Quick and easy each time, and if I were sight impaired I could see this being a great help to know there are thousands of US out here willing to “Be My Eyes.” Appropriate technology and use of crowd sourcing if there ever was one.",12/31/22 15:58,5
Be My Eyes,I think that the idea of this app is Ana it I have had two phone calls and each time is says we get disconnected? Has this happen to anyone else? I have had the opportunity for a few months?,03/26/20 20:22,3
Be My Eyes,"When I open the app all I see is a spinning icon (like it is trying to load) and thats it. I feel bad for all of the blind people who can’t be helped because of the crappy software of this app. Don’t waste your time giving this app your information, it doesn’t work.",01/22/20 2:22,1

Be My Eyes,"What a beautiful app. Not sure how else to put it. It's an amazing feeling to help someone in need, big or small. I got my first call after 1 day and the gentleman needed help sorting some bills that he had gotten out of sort. It was a pretty quick call, you can tell they're needing help. They need something from you and you get something in return - that great feeling of connecting & helping. The app works great, very simple to use and that's it.",11/05/19 18:25,5

Be My Eyes,"I know we have a lot more volunteers than people needing assistance. So we n Ed to be getting the word out to our visually impaired friends and community.

Trust me - we’re out here, so use the app as often as possible.",07/02/18 16:21,5
Be My Eyes,Huge respect for this idea! This is ad free. Need an update on following things. I can't see a proper response when I select my languages both primary and other under settings. And it always ask me to subscribe for news and loads the home page after clicking back even when I was in the settings page. That's all I've seen so far. Please fix so we can help at ease. So idea is great but app is not easily usable. Improve usability!,07/24/22 7:48,4

TapTapSee,This app is one of the best apps I've ever owned. This app has allowed me to be so much more independent. Most identifiers cost so much money that we cannot afford them. But this app allows me to do so much that I haven't been able to do in the past.,07/28/14 19:36,5

I would only want that the buttons you have on screen, to make them tabs that will be in one or two rows in the bottom of the screen, and the take a photo button on the middle of the screen. So the interface would be more intuitive. Also, please make an option in settings to toggle off the automatical use of some tabs, like colour detection.

Seeing AI,"I love using the products mode for identifying not only food, but also cleaning products and also DVDs. I love how it will give you cooking directions or if you’re looking at a DVD it will tell you what the movie is about. I have not tried out the money Channel yet but from what I have seen in  videos it works well. I also love using the document channel for reading mail. The handwriting mode also works great. My husband and I tried it out and we both were amazed that it read his handwriting. It told me Exactly what he wrote without any mistakes. It is small things like being able to read a handwritten note from a friend or family member that really makes this app special. I would love to see medication be added to the bar code scanner. This app is great. Please keep updating it.",06/27/18 15:59,5

Seeing AI,"I have an iPhone 7 and have the most up-to-date iOS. I find this app to be more of a pain in the butt to try to get it to function than it is helpful. I just spent 15 minutes attempting to find out what this box of medication is, and I am still without an answer. This is not the only example of the trouble I regularly have with this app; it is just The most recent incident.
 I don’t know if other users who’ve written reviews are paid by Microsoft or are using non-Apple products with the app, but I find it to be far more of a hassle than the TapTapSee app, which is still pretty darn sucky.",08/04/19 13:55,1
Be My Eyes,Brilliant way to Help,07/31/19 8:52,4
Be My Eyes,"Such a fun way to help other people! The calls take literally 20 seconds to about 2 minutes, and it’s just simple tasks that are easy for sighted people but are an obstacle for the blind. I get giddy whenever a call comes through because there are so many more volunteers to users 😊",11/03/22 20:13,5
Be My Eyes,"Just another app to take up space on the phone and collect information.  Signed up to be a volunteer and literally received no phone calls.  Why have an app constantly running, taking up space, for it to not even be used?",07/03/19 16:58,1

I absolutely love to be able to identify foods without having to pay expensive overly priced prices for equipment that’s outdated. One thing I would love to see you guys improve on in that category though is, when the product is not recognized, there should be a way for the app to go out and grab the relevant information about the product that you have scanned into the app. That way, we can actually identify what the product is without having to rely on somebody who can see to tell us what it is.",03/19/19 14:26,5

I got my first call this morning and was so excited but was stuck trying to connect the call for 10 minutes . I sat my phone down on the charger hoping eventually it would connect.

Be My Eyes,"This app helps me read through complex flyers and graphics like menus and poster boards. It also helps me summarize bills and letters in paper format. It can also translate written text into Spanish, which is beneficial for me since my family is bilingual. My only complain is that the volume buttons are used to take a picture and run into situations where I accidentally want to put the volume up and end up taking a picture of something else and losing my previous image description. I wish they would have a setting where the volume buttons were not used to take a picture. I haven’t used the volunteer feature since I have a lot of remaining vision, but use the artificial intelligence for reading documents and other small things around the house.

How do I get it to talk to me? Occasionally it barks out words, but inconsistently. I am so frustrated - and very confused. I hope there's a work around, but shouldn't the reader come as standard, rather than text in app? What's going on? Whats the point of an app for the blind that you need sighted companions to read?",08/29/24 14:02,2

He wants to ask: In Documents program
Where are the photographed letters stored?
How can I find them to read again?
How do I delete letters already stored?
Would be easier to turn camera on/off WITHIN App. instead of in SETTINGS. Also tapping to change programs as the gesture doesn’t always work.

Be My Eyes,"Not only have I been an assistant to my local blind/visually impaired community for the last 30 years, my clients have turned me on to this wonderful application. 

My clients have always contacted me via Skype or FaceTime to help them and it was always with consideration when I was free. This application allows them, as well as over 100,000 others, the opportunity to call when they need it for small or big needs. 

It’s truly a blessing to have my own sight yet it’s even more rewarding helping others, who otherwise, wouldn’t have help at all. 

Encourage those who have kindness in their hearts to use this application—it allows independence and privacy for those who need it most!

And a big thank you to the developers of this application. You have opened a world of independence for those who need it as well as satisfaction who can help.",03/04/19 8:04,5

He was talking about how he had hardly any money and didn’t know what to do. And he kept talking about it to the point it seemed like he wanted me to send him money. And he was walking around a park and he seemed to know where he was going while he was walking around. There would be things in the way and he would walk over them without using a walking stick. Like he could see... the whole encounter felt odd",11/19/21 3:53,1

The apps like these!, the ones that truly make things better for others, are not often found and it would be such a better place if we were able to ha e more apps like theses as it can serve as a reminder to be grateful for what we do have and to remember that when we think it’s the worse it actually is worse for others and it can put a little nudge in your ear that says, “seriously?” Here I am complaining about this when there’s people that will never know what the sky looks like, or the color of rain!

Envision AI,Please add 1 button to start scanning manually also where it stops while scanning. . By that button we will be able to start the scanning from where it is stopped. Suppose we have the pdf of 5 pages. In that document PG NO. 1 and 2 is scanned. PG NO. 4 and 5 is scanned. But PG NO. 3 is not scanned. There should be the button to retry the scanning for the PG NO. 3. It creates problem in large pdf documents.

Seeing Eye GPS,"For over two years, I've been an avid user of your app. However, there have been two major blows recently. First, when you gave up Google POI's. The second blow is coming right now, when you have discontinued the annual subscription option. 
Please bring back the annual subscription, with better pricing compared to the monthly option. Otherwise,purchasing this app no longer makes sense for me. 
Thank you!",08/16/19 8:13,3
Be My Eyes,"I saw the ad on somewhere. I looked on App Store and said I need to get this right now. First call I helped the woman choose clothes. It really puts a huge smile on my face for a easy and caring thing that a lot of humans can do. I got a few more calls. I love it!! You get to help people no trouble. I myself is disabled. I have a prosthetic leg. If it was switched I would really be thanking the creators and volunteers for simple kindness. I’m disabled, but not enough to not help someone else disabled or not disabled. This is one of my favourite apps. Also you can be rated. Don’t worry getting bad volunteers because than they could not get calls when you rate badly. One thing that is a less joy and more of a curse is the numbers of volunteers. The number grow everyday and so I get less calls. But every call. I smile so big. Thank you creators. This is one of my favourite apps.",02/07/19 13:26,5

Be My Eyes,Amazing idea with an easy-to-use app.  Makes helping people simple and fun.  One suggestion - a timing function that logs in/out at certain times (so I don't have to remember to log in after I log out at night or during work).  Even a reminder/notification would be helpful.,10/23/17 15:17,5

Be My Eyes,Cool idea. One thing missing is possibility to recall the same volounteer (in short time). Scenario I had some time ago: a blind person called with a questions to help installing system on PC. At some point he had to check wifi password on his phone so had to end call but he also wanted to continue with me so he wouldnt have to start everything from begining (explaining) and previous volounteer wasnt helpful so he was afraid next person wont be helpful also :),04/16/23 7:42,4

Digit-Eyes,"I also find it very useful to identify spices… I pondered for weeks and had to label my spices and realized that they already have a barcode on them and I just scanned them and know what is what… Totally awesome… if you have trouble printing labels to years… Just spend a couple dollars and buy some from Digit-Eyes… It isn't worth the prostration I am always very hesitant to spend money on apps… I reluctantly bought this airport $10 and as I say… It's worth $10,000 to me… there is a slight learning curve to learn how to find and scan the barcode… But in a day or two… I am old pro… If you have questions… They are there to answer the telephone… That is a big plus there is some prostration with learning to find the barcodes… But be patient… Work with it… And… As I say… It is worth it's weight in gold… another thing that is pretty cool about the app is when it recognizes the barcode you hit the more information link and in many instances it gives you nutritional data for that particular product… also… Some products will give you cooking instructions also no more six or seven open cans in the fridge that were mistakenly identified last week and never use because I open the sauerkraut when I was looking for the kidney beans… LOL",06/17/17 19:28,3

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The update made it completely unusable for those of us who are blind, and hearing impaired. Now it doesn’t automatically open to the cross street function. It opens to a map when you can’t hear on the go and use a braille display you can’t get it to where you can open the cross street function. It’s completely unusable now. I shouldn’t have to pair my braille display. Take it with me and do 30 functions every time. I’m at a street corner trying to cross the street. There are 80 apps out there that do point by point directions. I don’t need another one. Oko Was good because it was simple and it did one thing no other app did. now that is ruined.

ETA: from your response, I can’t tell if you are a bot or if you just don’t understand anything about Deafblind folks and how we use tech. First of all, although I, personally can voice, many DB people can’t. So a Siri shortcut isn’t going to work for many. It can also be hard even if you can voice in very noisy situations. Second, the button on the first screen than comes up when you open the app is in (or next to) the search field. It still takes a few steps to get there, instead of just opening the app and having it work. If you are DB and can’t hear voiceover and use braille display, or even if you are blind and at a loud intersection and can’t hear voiceover, this makes it difficult to impossible at every intersection to have to do this. No one wants to stand there and struggle at every intersection for 5 minutes screwing around with an app that used to just work upon opening and pointing. Third, I know how maps with turn by turn directions work. They’ve been around for decades. There’s the seeing eye app, find nearby, blind square and even just google among others. This feature does not enhance your product. You don’t need directions for every route you walk. You do get an advantage from getting intersection help. You are trying too hard. You took an innovative product that was elegant in its simplicity and ruined it. You can fix it by making an option, at least, to get the ped signal function immediately upon opening. Until then, the app is still unusable for many people and more difficult for everyone. Until it’s fixed, I would still give it 0 stars and that award you just won should really be revoked if you are going to screw the DB out of the app among many others. Yes, I am mad. You response was a condescending “sighted-splain.” Do better.",06/12/24 12:16,1

It is 100% safe in that you never know who is calling or even what country they may be from. I live in the U.S. but have been fortunate enough to help a man in Israel pick out matching pants & shirts, helped a woman in England find ingredients for a stew, helped determine the temperature setting on an oven and helped another with the name of cds.

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I have used this app for some time and it usually ends up being more of an exercise in frustration than an actual help. It may work better for reading a page of nicely formatted text, but it doesn’t work at all for helping to read a paper that I need to read and sign. The understanding of what sections of the page come next seldom works, and it tends to chop off words at each side of the paper - even after telling me to “move further away from the page” until there is more than 1 inch background around each edge of the paper. Overall I have rarely been able to get it to correctly read a page even after months of trying.",02/13/21 13:26,1

I answered a call today, answered the question, and then the person started trying to find out where I was/lived. That is not okay at all. This should strictly be for helping and you should be able to report people that attempt to do this.

The information I have gotten from this app has never been accurate, or at least not even close to what comparable apps in the app store have been. Why is it, that BlindSquare, and other certain apps, lock on to my address all the time, not some of the time, and that they get it right every single time? If I were in the orientation and mobility instructing field, I would never allow my students to use this app. Not now, not ever, until something drastically changes.

He has to use Siri to open the app but Siri won’t let him close the app to reset it, meaning someone with good sight has to do it for him (they could just read whatever he was trying to read at that point).
If it would open with the camera and nothing on the screen at all, and simply read text the camera saw it would be great.",04/07/23 7:53,1
Be My Eyes,"Should have dropped this a long time ago. I love the app, I love that we're given an opportunity to help. I've received a total of about 5 or 6 calls and only one was disrupted.

Be My Eyes,Really amazing and rewarding to be able to help others,05/10/19 1:02,5
Seeing AI,I was so excited to find this app for my mother who is completely blind. She uses the voiceover for all functions on her phone. When she went to use the app the voiceover recognized the buttons at the bottom as one large button instead of individuals. This makes it impossible to switch from say short text to product scanner. It’s always stuck on the short text button. It would be an amazing app if this wasn’t an issue. Sadly we’ll have to look for something else until this is fixed.,05/20/18 18:16,2
Be My Eyes,"I love helping others see through this app! Also i love that my feedback goes directly to the app creator. My only suggestion is to maybe add call stats (# of calls/time, etc) a rating, and or a chat feature.",01/28/23 3:55,5

Seeing Eye GPS,"I was really excited when I discovered that Sendero GPS now known as seeing eye GPS moved to the iPhone. Have been using Sandra products for nearly 15 years. Enjoyed each succession and I am very proud to be a active user of the Seeing Eye GPS. I am a guy dog handler who travels daily as a pedestrian as a bus fixed route bus traveler as well as an Uber rider. I also travel by Gray hound, and I fly regularly. A GPS app as for most drivers is awesome and if you are blind, it is just as necessary. You are able to give directions actively as I do helping to navigate new communities with my friends. Even in my hometown we go new places and said of just sitting there waiting to get there, I can be an active part of the trip. I went to a party in a neighboring community with a friend or a couple months ago. It was a 30 mile trip and I was able to help my friend know were each turn was, and we arrived actually quicker than we thought we would she was very grateful for the app as well. So thank you send Darrow thank you for everyone who is a part of it and thank you for all that thank you for the partners such as Googal and others who contribute to the success of seeing a GPS. I have dictated because I do not have a reliable keyboard, but please except my sentiment. This is an awesome app and I really appreciate having it and it making my travel and the travel I do with others safe and accessible.",05/28/18 7:00,5

Seeing Eye GPS,"Maybe I just expect too much.  I thought paying $70 for an application would mean it's a treat app - from a name I know and trusted. I am legally blind, so I have some eye sight - enough to know I could not see the map and I should not zoom in.  Then,I tried finding a POI.  It consistently missed the local grocery store and wanted to send me 30 miles away.   I could not cancel a search for a POI.  I could not save a POI or route.  I could not do the main thing that is important to me -- identify those intersections with cut curbs and traffic lights.  It may be good for telling me where I am, but it is not good for telling me where I beed to go.",07/03/13 16:39,1

Assisting people who are visually impaired through technology is an amazing thing, and I’m glad Be My Eyes is making it easier than ever for visually impaired individuals to get a helping hand with everyday tasks. I’m seeing an alarming amount of people complaining about never getting calls - why? Doing the math, there’s around 125 volunteers for every 9 visually impaired users on Be My Eyes. You can’t expect to always get a call. Leaving 1-star reviews for that reason doesn’t help. You should be glad an innovation like this is helping people across the world.",06/07/23 14:55,5

Be My Eyes,"I love having this app on my phone. While I have only received two calls in the last 6 months (I was too late to answer my first call, but successfully answered the second call today!), it’s still amazing that I was able to help someone with something so small; something the rest of us take for granted every day. 

Today a woman called asking if I could help her adjust her thermostat. When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70°, so she counted the buttons up to 75° and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn’t need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) 

A lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn’t about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it. I think it’s wonderful that so many people volunteer, regardless of the number of people that need help.",12/16/19 19:10,5

For an example, if I wanted to take a photograph of a T-shirt with an owl on it, it used to tell me there was an owl and now it just tells me there is a t-shirt  with a pattern or something. It is not really the kind of detail level that I require. Same applies if I am trying to identify something in a tin. It used to tell me what was in the tin or at least give me an idea that I had got the label the wrong way round so I could turn it and then take the photograph again to get the information.

Be My Eyes,I really love this app because it allows me to help others. I typically only get a call about once every 3 to 4 months and it can be as easy as asking me what color a jacket is or the color of a suit. #PayItForward #LoveAll #LoveTheNeighbor,02/16/22 2:18,5

Be My Eyes,I got a notice that someone needed help but the app won’t load. It’s just spinning and spinning. Your app is useless if people aren’t able to get the help they need. Please fix this!,01/22/20 14:07,1

Seeing AI,"When you open the app if there was a better way to access channels by gesture it would be very beneficial. 

My blind friend received notification of software update. App became unusable because she can’t see where to press in the notification box to remove the notification and begin using the app. Either don’t have the notification appear or give a gesture to accept or dismiss the notification to begin using the app. 

Pause button too close to channel bar. Accidental press too easy. 

This is a wonderful app and amazing technology but there are several improvements that would actually help blind people.",05/18/18 9:48,4

Seeing AI,"This app is literally a dream come true for not only people who are blind or low vision but also for the profoundly dyslexic or otherwise print disabled people. My son is profoundly dyslexic and despite being 14 years old his ability to read print with his eyes is less than a first grade equivalent.  We have tried and use many apps and other technologies to help him access the world of print. Despite his struggles, he is a voracious consumer of audiobooks and this app allows him to access print around the environment with so much less effort than other apps. It also has very good accuracy. I also think the facial expression recognition feature has potential to assist people with Autism. Frankly, this app is just plain wonderful!!!!",11/13/19 17:36,5

Seeing AI,"Pro’s -
• Does what it says, how it says without glitches or ads.
• Doesn’t try to profit off the disability of others, giving us what comes free to others.
Con’s -
• People Recognition has to be done by taking their picture & many refuse to allow that. It would be easier if it can be done by a previously taken photo. This way permission isn’t needed to know who is around you!
• Vague description on objects & animals. Would love to know if it’s my dachshund or Chihuahua eating or just came in, I already know both are dogs!
Tips -
• To be a navigational assistance as well can erase the need of multiple apps & can be the one stop shop for the blind!
• Adding the option to use previous taken photos to recognize those around us.

I’ve gotten less than 20 calls in the years I’ve had the app. I have it always running so it can call anytime. I actually wish I could get more calls.

I'm generally very good at this, as I remember The order in which my pictures are displayed very well. She not only told me about the app, but also taught me how to use it after I downloaded it to my phone. Wow! I don't know of a better app out there for this kind of thing. Maybe Facebook should incorporate some of this apps technology/software into how it describes pictures.

The only thing that would make this app even better than it is would be if it described videos. Hopefully, the developers will get on that for a future update!",12/04/17 13:44,5

Seeing AI,"Had I left a rating sooner, it would be 5 stars. For the past several months, text detection has gotten worse. I use the app frequently to identify canned foods, and the short text feature was great for this. It would immediately start reading the cans. Now it takes me a couple minutes just to get it to read anything useful from the can to know what it is. Having an iPhone 14 Pro camera makes no difference from when I had a 12 Mini. One would think a better camera would help. Recent app updates hasn't improved anything for me either. Now I mostly use it for light detection to turn lights off at night. This is still a good app for a free service that is useful to the blind.",12/11/22 19:20,3

Be My Eyes,I can imagine how helpful this can be for those with sight issues.,06/16/18 16:35,5
OneStep Reader,"OK, simply put, if your visually impaired in anyway that you were not able to read text normally, I highly recommend this app, in fact, this app is far more superior to my Parul camera that I have on my computer. That being said, there are two issues, either that or huge but would be nice if they got fixed.

1. Batchmode - this mode allows you to take photos of multiple pages before the app processes the images into text to read to you. The problem is that this mode has a tendency to crash randomly, making the user have to routinely save the batch every 15–20 pages.

2. Photos - for whatever reason, this app holds onto the photos of the pages. This makes sense for legally blind users who want to see any photos that were on the page, but for the 95% of the rest of the time it makes this app a major memory hog if you use it a lot or if you use it to say scan a text book for school. I would really recommend the developers to give the option to delete the photos to help conserve memory on smart phones as well as when it backs up to the cloud.

Side from those two things, yes the price is very steep but it is so worth it if you prefer to just have all of your visually impaired and blind tools on one device rather than walking around like Batman with the utility belt.",02/03/16 11:14,4

Seeing AI,"The app is very good for blind and low vision. I have been told about this snap numerous of times. And I find that it is very useful because it helps us with the following tasks that we as individuals do from day today. From coming home after work, or school and checking our mail is able to read our mail to us so we don’t have to look for sighted assistance, being able to identify products such as food soda and chips etc. And being able to identify current sea, as well as take pictures.

Be My Eyes,Perhaps the most satisfying app I have. One way that I could be of help. I cannot tell you how content you feel when you are of some use to someone via this app. Reduced the stars as i see blind folks are not even using it. 3L users only. Can we not undertake initiatives that use volunteers to increase usage of this app?,08/19/21 2:28,4
TapTapSee,"Tap tap see is impressive and its ability to recognize so many things! I even gave it something that I knew the identity of, to see what it would do with it, and it actually recognize the item!

TapTapSee,It uses voice over which is not helpful for somebody with my slow movement.

Be My Eyes,"Really Luv the concept of this, my only request would be to be able to change the call/notification sound to one of your own & one that would realise its a call, the standard notification is so random & doesn't happen often so it takes me a minute to realise its my phone as I don't hear it often so have missed a couple of calls 😞",07/12/22 18:26,4
OneStep Reader,I am not willing to pay $99 for an app I can't even test before buying. I was hoping to see if this was a good app to recommend the parents I work with. Guess I won't be recommending it since I can't even see how well it works.,01/12/22 12:47,1
Be My Eyes,The app is very dodgy collection of all your movements. You can do the same with whatdapp video and atleast there you know who is guiding you. Why have a app that you entrust all your privacy in the hands of foreign people. Try whatsapp for that purpose let your family and friends be your eyes..,04/26/20 17:54,5

Be My Eyes,"I’ve just had my first call on Be My Eyes: A visually impaired chap from the UK needed help to check how much money he had remaining on his electric meter.

To a visually impaired person who lives alone, these simple situations can prove challenging! The video call only lasted about 45 seconds, very little time, but undoubtedly it helped this chap greatly. He seemed very appreciative of the help.

What a great little app. Kudos to the person(s) who coined the idea. I’m looking forward to helping someone on my next call.",08/23/20 1:15,5
Seeing AI,I was so excited to find this app for my mother who is completely blind. She uses the voiceover for all functions on her phone. When she went to use the app the voiceover recognized the buttons at the bottom as one large button instead of individuals. This makes it impossible to switch from say short text to product scanner. It’s always stuck on the short text button. It would be an amazing app if this wasn’t an issue. Sadly we’ll have to look for something else until this is fixed.,05/21/18 1:16,2

Be My Eyes,"I have used the app on my iOS device for quite a while and I found it to be quite useful. I've just now started using the AI feature which is very interesting and seems to be quite accurate. I'm waiting for the AI feature to become available on my Android device as well. The only suggestion I would have is to see if the button to take a picture can be switched or at least modify to work from the volume buttons, therefore minimizing the movement of the device as you're taking the picture.",09/15/23 4:57,4
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I find this app very amazing. I’m never going to delete it ever under any circumstances. however, I find it hard to sign in or create an account because I have never created an account before for this app. I’m unsure how and that is the only issue.

Be My Eyes,I downloaded The app to help people that can't see. I've gotten two calls within the past two months that I have downloaded the app and both of the calls have not gone through. As soon as I try to answer that call the app shuts down. I think this is such a cool idea and I would love to be able to help someone but it doesn't seem to be working so I don't know if I keep the app on my phone much longer.,07/12/17 18:11,2
Be My Eyes,I'm extremely grateful for this service. As my eyes continue to get worse I continue to get more apprehensive. Thanks to this app some of that has subsided. Knowing help is just a phone call away provides a comfort I needed.,01/30/19 10:05,5

It was a brief and very comfortable call, I requested some minor hand adjustments to enable the camera to clarify the message and soon read it out.

Be My Eyes,"Try it and wrate it please guys and girls.
As I previously said, it's a wonderful app which offers a great service.
My only reason to give it 4 of 5 stars because when you sometimes ask for help nobody is there to get your help and except it,  and this is because it depends on the time and on the availability 
But when she, or he answers, there are so cool and helpful and so nice to meet.
For the call quality, it is clear with no latency at all, this is on my humble opinion.
Thank you so much, and I know I'm asking for so much but, we hope in the future you're going to make it like a 24 hour service.

Kind regards",11/05/15 9:56,4
Be My Eyes,"Great Idea! Unfortunately due to there being too many volunteers, I have 
not gotten any notifications from blind persons needing help and I have 
been using the Android and iPhone apps for a while. Maybe there should be a 
limit on the number of people who volunteer so EVERYONE can get a chance to 
help.",06/21/18 16:20,1

Supersense - AI for Blind,This app is brilliant the only reason it has one star is because it uses The subscription model if any developer reading this has children imagine being blind and somebody comes along with the ability for you to see your own child but it will even cost you £4 a month or 99 upfront why should I have to pay that much just to be able to do something everybody else can do for free for £99 u need toGive blind people something sighted people don’t have at all so nothing less than x ray vision,11/08/20 13:50,1

Be My Eyes,What a wonderful concept. Very easy to download the app and get set up. I had my first call and wow how amazing it was that I could be of service to someone in another state/ time zone. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to sign up and be of service.,01/14/18 3:36,5

Seeing AI,"I literally fell in love with this app, how quickly it computes and reads off information and words in real-time... The creators of this app should be really proud of themselves. The one problem I have with this is the cancel ""x"" buttons. I'm not blind, but I found it hard to hit the ""x"" button. I feel like there could be a bother or better option to cancel the photo by, say, shaking the phone, double-tapping, etc. I think this app will go a long way!",07/13/17 3:03,5
Be My Eyes,I love the app and provide help to others in need. Its a way to provide your Act of Kindness and volunteer experience since this is no cost to you to help. Had numerous experience of helping through this app,06/02/23 15:09,5

 I hope that I gave good information and advice. As someone with multiple sclerosis, my eyes have been affected and I know what it feels like to need a little help once in a while. 

I’m extremely grateful to be able to help those who are blind & hopefully bring some positivity and a kind word to each person.",04/28/24 0:22,5

Be My Eyes,Just had my third call on Be My Eyes I've been on the app for years and every now and then my phone will ring. I can choose to decline and the app calls multiple people so sometimes you answer and it's already been answered. Today I helped a gentleman figure out whether his frying pan was dishwasher safe. In the past I've clarified clothing colours and read someone's meter. It's a really lovely moment getting to chat with someone and help them and I always come away feeling positive.,02/23/25 6:29,5

Be My Eyes,There's nothing more amazing than being able to help someone when they need it. I've yet to be called but my daughter and mother have and it was amazing to watch them help someone as soon as they needed it. It takes a village! And this app helps us all connect to be a part of that village. I can't recommend this app enough.,11/30/22 19:29,5

As “eyes”, you must sometimes get creative in making things work in your conversation. Patience is key when you are “eyes”. 
I have spent a few years working with the developmentally delayed, and saw the potiential in this app when I signed up. 
100% recommended this app for those that enjoy helping others. And for those who needs some “eyes” to help them out.",07/03/23 20:07,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,"My Dad has dimentia. We used this as an experiment. It identified a low percentage of items in explore mode, and mislabed a few. Honestly, for Google's many AI developers who are paid millions of dollars a year, I would expect more from this. Software feels more like a college dorm prototype.",05/28/22 13:36,2
Seeing AI,"Overall, I have found this app very useful and accomplishing day-to-day tasks such as identifying canned goods or sorting the mail. However, it is very inconsistent ( and unacceptably so) in its ability to read the output of digital displays. FYI, I am speaking throughout this review of the short text channel. I use this app every day to read my kitchen scale for making coffee and for other reasons. At times, it reads the output quickly and accurately. At other times, it takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to read the display. Words are inadequate to describe the frustration I feel when a 30-second task turns into a 10-minute one, draining my phone battery all the while. If a pair of human eyeballs can read the display, then there should be no reason why Seeing AI cannot also read it. This problem seems particularly exacerbated by readings that end in either 1 or 7 (such as 21 G). The app has no problem reading the labels of the buttons on the scale, but it all too often fails to read literally the only thing on the display I want to hear. Perhaps a new channel could be created in the app that is optimized specifically for the reading of displays. Please work on this! In a world in which many home appliances are still inaccessible, it is more important than ever that blind people have access to an app like Seeing AI that is capable of reading a display. My rating reflects the frustration caused by the app's seeming inability to accomplish one of its core functions in situations that I need it most. I commit to updating my rating when this issue is addressed.",04/26/24 11:08,2

Be My Eyes,"The my eyes is an unbelievable app. I have many many apps, but be my eyes is probably my favorite. I can’t tell you how much it has assisted me in so many many situations. I am a single person and have many sighted friends, but There is a lonely in my own condo and use Be My Eyes many times a week. I thoroughly enjoy talking with all of the Be My Eyes volunteers, not only in the United States, but in other areas of the world, as well. Their help is unbelievable and I appreciate it more than I can say. Thanks so much to the developers and all of the volunteers who are there day and night even for the smallest questions. This is an absolutely marvelous application for anyone who is blind I truly believe it is a must-have and I am anxiously awaiting a new version with even more features thank you so much to the developer",10/16/22 14:07,5

Be My Eyes,You have saved my life... something to live for...a big thanks to your parents who gave you such a beautiful upbringing... right from my school days I was trapped in the idea whether science and technology is boon or a curse... people like you can really proove it to be a Vardaan as we say in India... please continue the good work and do a lot on the similar lines... count me in for any assignments which also needs volunteers...in the end I may sound little selfish but couldn't resist in being part of such a team of good people... keep up the good work...,12/18/17 6:14,5
Be My Eyes,I volunteered to help on this app and picked up a call within a couple of days. I was subjected to indecent exposure by someone who clearly was not blind. This app has good intentions but is too open to abuse.,01/25/20 15:09,1
Seeing AI,I like this app. I use it to read my recipe books and it is pretty accurate.,03/08/21 16:53,5
Envision AI,"unlike seeing ai, this app is not created by the monopoly Microsoft, and actually works. It successfully scans QR codes without saying product not found. Color detection works great and text reading works great.

only two things I would suggest, is adding a Money Reader function, and a light  detector..  also, I noticed the scan QR code function, it will read a barcode, but then to read another one, you have to close the app entirely, and re-open it back up again to read another barcode. Also if it doesn’t detect the barcode for some unknown reason it doesn’t tell you it’s just stop scanning for one after about five seconds, so you have to hit scan QR code again, wait for it,, sometimes it detects it sometimes it doesn’t. If it doesn’t then you have to exit the app again and open the app back up again. If you have no idea  where the barcode  is at,  this is a bad thing because if you can’t see the QR code,  the app doesn’t give you enough time to locate where the barcode is at. at times out at literally five seconds and that’s not near long enough. But once you can get it to scan, it does detect the code correctly.

I took advantage of the August summer sale even though I am without an income right now, but figured it was worth the sacrifice for such a great app. It has so much potential for the future as well that I couldn’t pass up the deal.",08/31/19 10:24,3

Seeing AI,"so easy to use! 
I've been able to read vending machine info,  My t-shirts,  train station signs and info,  and train numbers on the train as it is pulling into the station. 

The app easily reads touch screens  and button panels,.  There now needs to be a way to match button text with a particular button on the panel.  This is easier with a large vending machine,  harder with an appliance such as a radio or washing machine.  

If someone wears glasses they have to put their picture in twice with and without the glasses. 

It would be awesome if the sceens app could report relavent information such as an empty seat,  trash can, vending machine,  all the things you want to find when using public transportation and facilities.",08/18/17 2:44,5
Be My Eyes,"Just singed up to be a volunteer so I havnt even received my first call to be of help to someone nevertheless, I am so excited to be able to provide such simple yet vital aid to another induvidual in need. Very quick set up that took may be 4 min total, including doing a practice of how to answer a call and watching the very breif video within that practice.

I plan to use this app a lot. You do have to often take 3 to 4 pictures. If you take enough pictures, you can get more detail. But perhaps this is user trial and error.

Be My Eyes,I think this is such a great app. I have helped a man find a sweater he was looking for and also helped out another man who couldn’t remember what he purchased from Amazon and couldn’t tell from the bottle.

OneStep Reader,"I personally love the KNFB app. It has worked remarkably well and has been a real life changing app. The ""but"" is there because lately it has been more unusable than usable. The KNFB app really started going downhill just before the iOS 9 update and got worse on the iPhone 6s. At that time, we had to wait forever to get an update just to make the KNFB app usable. I say forever, ""but"" it was really only about a month; ""but"" for as much as I use the app that felt like forever. The app worked good after the update at first, ""but"" now the speech rate is all kinds of crazy and it will not save my settings. The most annoying problem though is that the app constantly crashes. If I scan multiple pages the app will get about halfway through the conversion and then crash. Making me start all over again; causing me to waste an enormous amount of time! Now, again, I have been waiting 2 weeks for an update to correct the issues. This is very frustrating because of the amount I use the KNFB app. Also, (this might just be me) ""but"" I believe if I pay $100 for an app I shouldn't have to work through constant crashes, messed up speed rates, and reset my settings every time I open the app. I understand it takes time to go through the process; so maybe I'm just too inpatient.

Be My Eyes,Helped one guy and it worked amazing.,12/12/21 14:18,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app I love to get calls and help out. I just got a call and I was helping a guy out he wanted to put together a cabinet from IKEA I was free so I didn’t mind knowing it would take awhile. Well after about maybe 1.5hrs the call ended saying the max time was exceeded. I felt bad now he have to get another person to try to help him start where he left off at who probably doesn’t have a free day to help him out. I don’t think there should be a time limit for this very reason but that was my very first call so that’s the only issue I have thus far.,11/01/24 17:57,4
Be My Eyes,What an altruisticly amazing app,08/11/18 16:45,5

TapTapSee,I got this for my blind father. He is still learning to use it but even I have fun trying to stump the app! I hope in the future the app will improve and advance so it could read everything and that the camera was more like the one on the money reader app. He can't tell if the pic is in focus when he takes it.,10/22/13 16:34,4

Be My Eyes,idea is great!! but doesn't work for my Android phone. so far I got 4 calls and all the calls had technical issues. my first two calls I couldn't connect because upon answering the call (immediately) I got an error saying sorry couldn't connect. third time I was able to hear a person s voice but his video kept loading. 4th time even after answering the call the screen was just blank..no voice/video. p.s. all the time I was on good 4g network so this was no network issue from my end.,08/08/19 14:06,3
Be My Eyes,Really cool concept and it feels amazing to help someone out especially since it takes almost no effort at all. Only complaint is I don’t get enough phone calls to help out 🤣,03/23/23 1:21,5

Be My Eyes,"It's a brilliant concept, but appears to be suffering from technical glitches. I only had two calls so far, but one of them wouldn't connect properly. Also, it would be much better if you could set different times for availability. I'm a night owl and would quite happily take calls after 9pm, but not in the morning. An option to add more than one language would be great, as well. I'm bilingual, but there is no way of adding a second language. Apart from that, I think it's great!",09/12/21 4:45,3

Be My Eyes,"Answered my first call today as a volunteer and feel great.  This app is a win win, the person calling was able to get on and make the drink he wanted once I had identified which bottle he needed.  Connecting human beings like this allows the caller to get on with their life and brings joy to the volunteer knowing they have helped. I tell everyone I know about this app to spread the word!",04/27/19 16:44,5

I absolutely love to be able to identify foods without having to pay expensive overly priced prices for equipment that’s outdated. One thing I would love to see you guys improve on in that category though is, when the product is not recognized, there should be a way for the app to go out and grab the relevant information about the product that you have scanned into the app. That way, we can actually identify what the product is without having to rely on somebody who can see to tell us what it is.",03/19/19 7:26,5

Be My Eyes,"Being able to help people like this is such a rewarding experience. As an endlessly busy person, it’s easy to get wrapped up in my own world trying to juggle everything I have going on at once. This app enables me to give back from anywhere at any time. I’ve helped someone while riding the bus to work. I’ve helped someone while cooking dinner in my kitchen. I’ve helped someone while browsing the aisles in Target. If I could, I’d put myself at the top of the list to be called on more to help. That’s how much I love it every time.",03/11/19 1:27,5
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded this app months ago, or late last year and have been waiting for a call since then. I got my first call just now but unfortunately I couldn't speak Spanish and the person that needed help only spoke Spanish. I badly wanted to help, and I was so excited to help too. I hope there would be a feature where in they could match the caller to the people who can speak the language. :( really sad I couldn't help and I feel guilty now too. Hoping this would be improved!",07/10/21 21:57,3

This is help me when my alarm clock stopped voicing and the alarm like dots didn’t work I call people every night for a month and they were so helpful.

Be My Eyes,I'm eager to help on this great app but it's a bit of an issue when I get a call at 3.45 am ( local time )  so please can you add a function to able to say when we are able to help and when we are not ? .... I hope so 'cause I don't want to sound selfish in any way at all and I'm truly glad I can make a good difference in some one else's life through a genuine way like this :-),10/11/17 11:44,4
Be My Eyes,"Wow, I just got my first call. Helped a gentleman set his alarm clock, and he was happy.

Be My Eyes,"Only signed up yesterday. In less than 24 hours I received my first call from someone over in the USA, I am in the UK. The gentleman who called me had come back from shopping and wanted to know whether his dog had used the ‘training toilet’ he had placed in his kitchen while he had been out, which his dog had. Such a simple request but one that assisted him. Took no time at all. Was a pleasure to help. Hopefully I can assist more people in the future. Great app.",07/25/24 13:05,5

She had issues logging into her work VPN, after I solved her problem and got her logged in, she had an additional issue with her work laptop and told her she needed to advise her IT department because it was something I couldn't fix. It was an IT question and that is my field of expertise. After I helped her she literally hung up on me saying nothing!!",01/23/23 16:30,5

Be My Eyes,Wow so cool to be able to help,09/02/21 11:16,5
Be My Eyes,I really love this app in the way that it helps people. I’ve had this for about two years now and have been able to answer about four calls. I help someone make a homemade pizza and also help someone get things at the grocery store! I get the calls every so often but normally someone always picks up before I can which is great that someone can be helped! Unfortunately my last call was an extremely rude person and a VERY inappropriate. Not sure how this app could filter that sort of thing because it’s not like you can ask someone prove that blind or not! 😬 i’ve seen lots of negative posts about this sort of thing and I am going to keep the app just in case I can help someone who is actually needing it and will just hang up on the inappropriate rude people.,02/11/21 8:20,4
Be My Eyes,Three months and no call for help...it's not for me.,06/01/21 18:00,1

Be My Eyes,"Bring a sighted user I love being helpful and it is the best app, I've only 
received one call so far and it was a pleasant one. However i do wish there 
was a option, in say a future update where you can select available or 
unavailable. In a video I saw which got me excited to try this app it 
states that if during the middle of the night it would connect a visually 
impaired individual in the UK. Which likely the best avenue. However in my 
situation I work 12 hour days and 12 hour graveyard shifts rotating each 
week, so having a option to say I'm available now or certain times during 
the day or night. Would be useful for me. I suppose if there are enough 
users it hardly matters. Just my two cents.",07/12/18 3:41,5
Be My Eyes,I haven't actually got to answer a call. I've gotten two notifications and i've been on this app since October of 2022. I just was busy when both of those came in. But I think it is a helpful app and it'll add some light to your day after you help someone in need. :),05/22/23 20:47,5

Be My Eyes,"A great app and a wonderful idea. I have been using this app for a couple of years on my iPad and have had the pleaure of helping several people.

I know that every call is gonna be different and I look forward to the challenge..,12/11/22 7:35,5

Seeing AI,"this app is the best all in one computer vision for the blind there is. I was sitting in a car and pointing the camera out the window and it was reading the signs. I used the scene recognition on myself and it said ""man with brown hair, wearing sunglasses,  taking a selfy"". I also was looking at wrinkled papers in the car on my lap and the ocr was almost perfect. I also love that it takes only a few seconds to find the barcode where as with other apps, it takes me 5-10 minutes. The best part, this is free!!! Microsoft, even though Windows 10 is terrible and you don't user test the surface pro with blind people, this puts your rating back to positive. This is one of the most amazing apps to have come out for blind people. thank you!",07/14/17 8:02,5
Be My Eyes,Nice Idea must help others,07/17/18 7:54,5
TapTapSee,"App used to work great. You could take a picture of just about anything(shirt, pair shoes, dresser, etc.), The app would be quick and accurate about getting back to you with what you were looking at. Regularly, I would use TapTapSee to sort through my paper money, never had any problems. About 2 to 3 weeks ago, I went to use the app for the purpose of sorting through my cash, and something had changed. Now instead of taking a picture of paper currency, and being told that I have either a one dollar bill, or say a $20 bill, I am told that I am looking at a grey and white stamp, or A piece of textile, or maybe even a pink wallet, even though there may be nothing of the sort in the picture.

I used to be able to depend on this app. Now I’ve come to depend on my phones magnifier, Which is much more time-consuming, plus the fact that I do not like to depend on what I’m looking at.",01/26/19 2:45,1

That select-mode button in lookout is not good. We would rather swipe. BTW, Microsoft, why is talkback actions not supported for switching modes? On IOS swiping up/down causes mode switching with voiceover. Also, please implement 2 finger double tap for taking picture. I don't wanna hunt for that take picture button.",12/10/23 11:31,5

My only beef? More than 5M assistants and 500k visually-impaired persons on the app means that I’m always attempting to answer the call before someone else! :::chuckle::: All in all, though, I think that’s a good thing!",06/09/22 11:14,5

today! It was so lovely to help someone so easily and we even had a 
wonderful brief conversation. It was so simple to use And worked perfectly 
although it was a shaky connection for the first 20 seconds.The only 
suggestions i have would be the ability to send text to audio messages to 
apologize for a dropped call,or to say thank you. If safety is a concern it 
can be done anonymously to the last person you were connected with. It may 
also be useful to be able to mark your favorite helpers should you have 
particularly successful communication with them.Thank You For creating this

Be My Eyes,"I have used this app for a year now and I love the concept of being able to help people. I have set my languages up for Spanish and English. I have not taken any English calls and always get Spanish calls which doesn’t concern me.

Some of the calls I get are people asking if I can read signs for them, Count money for them, read blood glucose readings, and so on. 

I don’t know why but the whole month of November I have been getting strange calls from people Spanish speaking asking me questions about how they can find me, where I am from, what’s my phone number or FB name. It’s making me want to delete the app. I have reported the calls but I haven’t received follow ups it makes me wonder are they really taking care of these people accounts there probably not blind at all. 

The last call really freaked me out he was whispering and very creepy and asking me all kinds of questions like if I am alone, if I like to party where do I live when I repeated to him how can I help you ? He said “ ohhh you can help me plenty it’s all ready for you. It grossed me out so much I hung up immediately and reported it. 

Use at your own risk I’ll be deleting this app unfortunately.",11/26/18 4:57,1

Matching clothes, putting together a flyer and matching font colors to graphics, things that people who see color have no issues with. The lady I spoke with was as sooooo sweet and helped me pick a. Font color that would be easily visible to those who can and can’t see color and one that matched the colors on my flyer I was making. It felt SO GOOD to be able to do something color based while I was home alone. It meant not having to stop what I’m doing and wait for a family member to come home or try to catch one of them on FaceTime. I can’t tell you how giddy it made me to just complete a task like that and go about my day. Thank you!!!!",01/28/20 17:11,5

Be My Eyes,"I would love to give this app more stars because it is a great idea and has helped people already. However, the developer makes the same mistake that a lot of folks do when it comes to the visually impaired. In order to use this as a blind person you have to have Voiceover turned on in the Accessibility section. Not all people that qualify as blind are totally blind. There is a good sized population that have some vision that don't use the Voiceover feature. I downloaded the app, thinking it would be great for me when I need help reading something. I tried out the Voiceover feature and did not like it at all. Since I don't like it, I can't use the app. Don't assume all blind people do things in the same way. Let us choose what accessibility features we want to use.",12/21/15 3:24,2

Be My Eyes,"It's an amazing app, and compared to 90% of them, this one is actually 
helpful",06/17/18 4:14,5
OneStep Reader,"This is a great app for single-page scanning! With a couple fixes it could be great for multi-page scanning, too (more about that below).

Bought at $50 (50% off the regular $100 price), its OCR has proven very accurate and quick, amazing me at how it can accommodate automatically for slightly curved pages and such. I appreciate how you can add pages to existing files at any time. Thanks to the developers who continue to refine the app!

While it is over 90% there, it is too rough for a $50 app (let alone $100 at the regular price). Scanning a document over 35-40 pgs consistently causes the app to crash. (I've resorted to scanning longer documents into multiple 35-page files in knfbReader, a rather untidy but functional workaround.) The app also lacks bookmarking, an essential feature for multi-page documents, especially for the visually impaired. I have resorted to exporting the text as a txt file and importing it into the Voice Dream app, which has superior text-to-voice and ereader capabilities than knfbReader (e.g. use a slider to move forward and back through the text, higher quality voices, automatic bookmarking saves where you left off, syncs with Pocket, displays the amount of time it would take to listen to a selection next to the name, etc.)

Note: I've noticed that the device you use to scan can make a significant difference in scan speed. Changing from an iPod touch 5th gen to an iPhone 6 doubled my scan speed, in part due to faster focusing. When possible, scanning two facing pages of a book at a time doubled my scanning speed again. Tip: Use as bright a light as possible to speed up focus time and, therefore, scan time's under lower light conditions focusing can take considerably longer.

A couple other requests include: 
- Cloud syncing between devices without requiring manually exporting from one device and importing into the app on another device
- More polished user interface

I am sighted and use this app to increase the number of articles and books I can go through by listening instead of reading. I tend to listen to more audiobooks than I read paper books, and my hope is to make more paper articles and books readily accessible in audio form. This app is a great example of how improving accessibility for some can improve it for all. 

In short, knfbReader is a diamond in the rough. At this price, I expect better quality. Once the crashing and bookmarking have been worked out, it could be magnificent. (Then, I would give it 5 stars.) The developers are actively working on it, so with continued effort they may yet refine knfbReader into a solid app worthy of the price.",12/26/17 8:44,4
Be My Eyes,So cool of a concept,08/30/24 17:26,5
Be My Eyes,"The only feedback on the app I have is that sometimes the cameras can’t find focus on the objects that people are asking about, particularly if the font on the object is smallish.

Be My Eyes,I just started using be my eyes. And is a fantastic application. I cannot believe the people that donate their time to provide such a service. I however do have a suggestion or 2 to improve the service. It would be fantastic if a volunteer would be able to tap on their screen to indicate where an item might be from a certain distance say for example I am looking for a bench. If they were to tap on the screen where the bench is then I would have a good general direction of where the item is.,12/04/20 19:24,4

Such an innovative way to contribute your time and help other while being in the comfort of your home. love the fact that it’s mobile so it’s easily accessible. 

I highly recommend this app/organization. I would love to see this program implemented in other ways such as helping someone deaf communicate with people, or to chat with the elderly as I know family members are too busy to call and they can get lonely. etc. 

I had a lovely conversation with nick who recommended me places to visit, talked about how a place used to be during his time etc. wow what a great talk. I LoVe this app!

Envision AI,I use this app every single day. Are used to use Seeing AI or a lot of other different apps and other devices like Orcam and E Sight. But I have found is this app actually takes the place of almost all of them! I am waiting for these guys to find a pair of smart glasses that will support their app on them! When are you guys going to put your app on a pair of smart glasses? I know you looked into views explains? Have you looked into the X2  by Third Eye Generation? I think you guys would partner quite nicely and they are quite inexpensive and allow for many different apps to go onto their App Store. I think I can’t wait for the partnership or at least with some other type of glasses because I am tired of hanging my phone from my neck to use your app all the time the facial recognition really doesn’t work well that way and I think you guys would be amazing in a pair of glasses and tent to some developer out there!!!,06/04/19 12:19,5

Be My Eyes,Hi I Love this app. I used it for the first time on Saturday morning. My seeing-eye dog had an allergy flare up on the left side of her left paw.  I got some help from a guy from Australia.  I had a lady helping me sort through my mail from Korea. I love the patience and dedication from the volunteers. The lady told me when I had to make the pages of the mail  clear for her to see them we both had a lot of fun guessing what type of mail I had in my hand. I recommend this app to anyone who is blind or visually impaired!,06/16/15 4:07,5
Be My Eyes,"I have only had 2 successful calls and the third was disconnected while the gentleman asked to to help him at a convenient store. 
All three times I could feel a connection of one human helping the other. They were all very kind and we joked a little. It’s an imprint on my heart that I’ll never forget. I have been a member for a few years and only had a few calls. So don’t be too discouraged if it takes awhile to get a call, or if you get to the request too late. It will happen and when it does it’s humbling to be able to help someone in that way. 
Thank you be my eyes! I am honored to be a piece of such a wonderful organization. Much gratitude to whomever created this app. Bravo!!",01/10/18 9:56,5

Be My Eyes,"My grandmother has lived blind since the 1970’s, an automobile collision severed both of her optic nerves. Since then she has learned to adapt and live a full and healthy life. The need for trained sighted guides is paramount for the lives of people who have no sight, trust is essential. This task requires the highest degree of empathy and selflessness. I guess the question is, how do we find the selfless folks who can donate their time from all walks of life in all languages because they not only care, but have experience helping the blind. It might be an impossible task, but one worth pursuing. Thank you for your time.",10/07/20 6:52,5

Because I couldn’t see my money, checks, uno cards game, math problems for class, movie box, and more. I tried to use app to pictures for we can read it. This is a really good help to read the photos a lot. I remember the TapTapSee if not free for taking pictures. I don’t need to buy more pictures after finishing pictures. So now they have a new update for I can make a free for photos a lot. Better for me. Make sure you can leave it there every time. Thanks very much for using free photos!

Be My Eyes,Why when I sign up it shows (authentication credential were not provided)!!?,10/24/18 16:25,5
Be My Eyes,"This App really makes it easy to be the eyes for someone with low vision or even blindness.  You answer a special ring tone if you have time (usually about 10 mins or so) if not someone else probably can get it.  I always try to make time when I can.  The callers need help with rather simple tasks and they know what they need but not being able to see is their only obstacle.  With CoVid 19 isolating low sighted and blind persons from their normal support group of sighted friends and family has left them in a lurch.  Once it was helping a lady find the right bills to pay for grocery delivery,  once helping a lady read her prescription number to a pharmacist over the phone, helping someone who needed to match an outfit for a job interview (not used to wearing business clothes) and helping with computer issues.  Nothing has been too hard or too time consuming and the feeling of being able to help someone pick the right train track can be a godsend to the person on the other end.  Reminds me not to take my sight for granted. The callers are very respectful of your time and truly appreciate the help.",09/23/20 1:49,5

One break or make test of an OCR app is out of focus text that isn't perfectly straight. Holding a bag of candies and scanning the ingredients, out of focus and not aligned, did quite well!

Be My Eyes,"I love the app. My sole criticism is that I ONLY want notifications when 
someone wants a helper. I DO NOT want notifications for a video or blog 
post that the app creators wish to share. At a minimum, there should be a 
setting allowing you to choose this. For now, I can't turn off 
notifications, because that is the only way I can be helpful, but I haven't 
gotten a notification for someone needing help the whole time I've had the 
app on Android. I've only received notifications to watch videos and read 
stories about the service. I helped several times when I has the app on my

The tasks I’ve been asked to do have all been simple, no one is asking you to do their taxes or anything.  Be patient, they can’t see so the camera might need to be adjusted.

When an impaired user needs assistance, you get an app notification. If you decide to accept the video call, it initiates the connection. If not, another available volunteer will. I’ve identified coupons, read paperwork, as well as other things. 
The calls are every few months, so it’s not often. But I definitely look forward to them when the notification pops up.

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded the app a few days ago. I haven't received any notifications or calls. 
I don't think I'm signed in Cuz asks me to sign up. But when I try to sign up again it just says the email already exists. But still has no SIGN IN option. 
This app has been horrible. 
Great idea. 
Big tease if you ask me",01/25/15 9:13,1

Be My Eyes,This is such a wonderful idea for helping the blind. The problem I have witnessed is that the call is transferred to another volunteer too quickly to answer with any success.,12/14/17 21:20,2
Envision AI,Best and easy to use app.,04/29/22 14:03,5
Be My Eyes,"I'm a volunteer on this app and I absolutely adore it. I get a couple of calls a month perhaps from blind people who need help with various daily tasks, such as identifying ""use by""-dates on packaging and we always end up having a lovely chat. It's really made me realise how little the world caters to blind people, so I'm now also supporting a charity that trains guide dogs. Highly recommend this app!",07/05/21 13:02,5
Be My Eyes,"A few tips for my fellow helpers- -When you are getting a call, tap the green ""answer call"" button rapidly, and it will pick it up quicker and easier than if you only tapped once. -If you are having trouble with clarity of text or pixilated video, use the camera feature in the lower left-hand corner to take a picture of the item, and all the text will be perfectly clear! What an amazingly helpful app!",02/29/24 9:04,5
Be My Eyes,The app really is an easy way to help those in need of assistance. I got my first call last week. It lasted a few seconds and it made me feel good to help a stranger. I recommend everyone download it.,02/09/23 17:55,5
Envision AI,Hoping that their is a money reader added to this application,11/09/19 14:37,3

Be My Eyes,"Bro I’m so glad the creators of this made this app a thing, it’s so nice being able to know you can help someone out. Already signed up!",06/18/21 7:14,5
Be My Eyes,The creators of this app deserve a nobel peace prize for “caring” enough to create a wonderful connection tool to help those see what they can’t. Cheers and 3 thumbs up,09/10/19 19:00,5
Be My Eyes,I absolutely love this app. Since there are so many volunteers I only answer a call fast enough every few months. But the people are always so kind. And the call quality is usually very clear. Everyone should have this app.,04/08/22 2:40,5
Be My Eyes,"AFTER MONTHS I FINALLY GOT TO THE CALL FIRST!

A blind dude couldn't figure out a new elevator interface so I spotted the buttons for him. Such a micro adrenaline rush to finally be the first responder to the notification.

Download this app, forget, then be notified of your chance to help! Join the 1.5 million who are on call for 100k. The future is pretty dope.

So stoked.",09/15/18 4:30,5
Be My Eyes,When it works it's great. For some reason it will no longer allow the option for notifications with Android. It automatically has then turned off and when you try to turn them back on it says this app doesn't send notifications (which is untrue because that's how you receive calls).,09/07/23 21:04,2

Be My Eyes,"Wonderful idea. I wish the app had a ringer volume control, I haven't heard 
this ring once in 7 months, although I'm told it has. Please, developers? 
Maybe a history screen too? The ratio of volunteers to those being served 
is alarmingly high (a ""good problem"") so don't expect to get a lot of calls 
to start with. Consider also volunteering at your local agency that serves 
this clientele. ;)",07/03/18 5:48,4

So far, I've had a few different people call me, and I've enjoyed a quick and pleasant conversation helping people who are blind to read what instructions are being displayed on their computers, or on some other random item or situation where there's no braille/audio available for them. Every time I helped them quickly and easily; and, was left feeling a sense of fulfillment. Get this app and feel good about yourself!",05/04/21 22:53,5

Be My Eyes,"i wanna prefix this review by saying this is a great idea for an app, but it’s cursed with poor execution. the first complaint about this app is that nobody has ever called me. it’s been around 1 1/2 years since i’ve gotten this app, just crickets. it would warm up my week if i got at least one call from someone, but this app doesn’t ever give me any calls. the other complain is that my grandpa has been using this app, but when he calls people to help him a lot of the times, people give him the wrong information. we’ve had a lot of hecklers call him to tell him things that aren’t true, and make his life even harder. i don’t get the point of letting anyone volunteer. this reminds me of the situation with betterhelp, it allows anyone to be a volunteer and supposedly “help others.” this is a great idea for an app, but it is too flawed.",08/10/20 0:00,3
TapTapSee,"It used to be a great app and it used to work really well but now you have to pay 9.99 for pictures for one month. I if you happen have the old version keep a hold of it and do not update it. t seems like that's a high price. This app is so good that I took a picture of a tv screen and it told me who was playing, that it was basketball, and that the score was 36 to 55 and the winning team.. Wow. I also regularly use it to snap photos of items that I can't identify. I am totally blind. And I can snap photos from inside of a car and it never fails to tell me what we are driving by. For example, it said at one point today ""photo of a car in parking lot with green trees and a brown grassy field nearby. "" this was taken from a moving car. Another great use of this app is to snap photos of food to make sure it is what you want to open. Snap a photo of each side of a box of food and it will analyze each side of it. Snap photos of people and it tells you what kind of shirt they are using. Amazing.",11/12/13 19:13,3
Be My Eyes,"It is an awesome idea for those in need of help and those who want to help.

Be My Eyes,"Much like what Bart Ouwerkerk said 5 days ago in his Jan.25,'21 review, I absolutely LOVED the idea of this app. My maternal grandmother was at the forefront of Braille translation, doing thousands of papers & books into Braille for many decades until she passed in 1974, & this app/idea felt like a tiny connection to her - a simple, fine way to assist the visually challenged. So I installed the app about 2-1/2 years ago. And then?...Zero. Zippo. Zilch! Not *one single call* in well over a year. Living where I do in N.E. of U.S. - a highly populated area of the world & just 25 miles from Manhattan - you'd think there'd be SOMEONE around (w/in 50 mile radius at least, w/so many cities nearby, much less globally!) that needed help at some point, but nope, not a one! Makes me wonder how that's logistically even possible. So I finally deleted it. Somehow, somewhere, something's not right. A real shame, I would've loved to help. Hopefully some are anyway.",01/30/21 17:25,4

Be My Eyes,"I rarely get requests, but when I do, it’s usually shortly after opening the app. Not sure if background refresh is causing this, or if there just so many helpers out there. Either way, the app works as intended and the idea behind it is lovely.",03/23/21 16:23,5

Be My Eyes,This simple little app alerts very infrequently but gives you the chance to help someone “see” what their phone is pointing at. In my case it’s been washing machine settings and selecting the right colour garment from the wardrobe. If you can’t take the call it goes to some one else. I have had it about a year and only taken two calls but each time it was so easy to help!,08/31/24 11:00,5

Be My Eyes,"What a marvelous idea! I’m blind, and though I’m very independent, I struggle with situations that aren’t issues for fully sighted people. For example, I frequently misplace things — often just out of reach. After groping around, often on hands & knees on the floor, I give up in frustration. With “Be My Eyes,” I get immediate assistance locating dropped or misplaced items. Thank you so much for this very clever and handy app!",07/03/20 11:02,5

Seeing AI,Absolutely love this app I use it all the time because whenever I buy groceries sometimes I may forget what I bot I need to figure out where to put it but sometimes it is hard for me to read the letters on boxes and things either because the letters are too small or the letters are too different from just normal print text seriously love this app. Thankyou! The only thing that I would say I would like to have if it’s even possible is I have a very hard time with expiration dates I always have to have someone come down and read it for me and I have not found a single app that has been able to find and read expiration dates don’t know if that’s possible if not that’s fine it would just be nice thing to have I’m even very skeptical about eating things in my fridge and pantry just because I don’t know if it’s any good or not and I don’t wanna have to call someone to say hey can you come tell if this is good or not so it definitely is a real problem for me don’t really know what else to do so if that is a feature that is possible to be added it would be great but again I very much love this app it has made my life so much easier thank you again,04/24/21 17:33,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve answered 4 calls so far, and they’ve all been great. You get to help someone, plus meet nice people. 

It’s not difficult at all. Someone calls, you answer. Then you help them adjust their thermostat, find their dog in the house, or something equally no-biggie, and maybe chat for a minute or two.

Such a great app!",06/11/21 15:59,5

Be My Eyes,"Amazing concept! I’ve only had one opportunity to assist. After my 1st Time, I wanted to help all the time! It gave both of us a great sense of joy. We worked together with such joy, great teamwork and accomplished what the blind person needed help with. On top of that, I noticed he had a leak in his ceiling he was unaware of that was huge and puckered with water. It was amazing as I’m based in CA and he is in FL. Distance doesn’t matter! It took about 10 minutes and I learned a bit about humanity and basic life necessity. It was humbling. The app is user friendly as a volunteer! I hope it is the same for the blind users! I’m an advocate and tell everyone about it!",11/25/17 21:17,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve been a volunteer for 5+ years and I’ve had the privilege to assist countless callers; many that I still think about to this day. No matter what assistance is needed- whether it’s shopping, choosing an outfit, finding something, counting money, using appliances, cooking, or being there on a walk as a safety net- there’s always a mutual level of trust and respect that just feels natural. I’ve enjoyed the experiences, bonding with users, and the ability to increase independence for others. I’ll always be there to answer.",03/16/25 2:33,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Downloaded for my mom who is going blind and it would be great but for some reason the language it's reading out is Spanish even though I have it set to english?? This would be a great app if it read the text in English as it's supposed to. Is this a bug or something that can be fixed?,09/06/23 8:11,2

Seeing AI,"I love this application especially when I seem to be in a jam. I can have mail read to me as well as products that I have purchased from the store. There’s just one small complaint. I noticed today that when I scanned a barcode, the app crashed. I’m not sure if Microsoft will continually work on this app so that updates can continue and things that I have mentioned above will not happen. I certainly hope so. Keep up the good work.",02/17/19 23:04,5

As long as you can verbally explain things in detail and not come off condescending and love to help people, download the app! I get a call maybe once every few months. So don’t expect to be a call center for the vision impaired, because calls are few and far. There are over 2 million helpers and 124k blind users with the app. So you can understand the delays.",04/10/19 15:59,5

Be My Eyes,"Suggestion: Add a feature that allows sighted volunteers to put in their 
""available hours"", i.e. hours when they are not working or sleeping. This 
will increase the chance that a suitable receiver (someone ready to help) 
is called, not someone who is not available.",05/19/18 15:29,4

The caller said he was switching some mode or something right after we said hi, and it froze after that, so I wasn’t able to help. Disappointing and frustrating. 
There were a few other calls that even tho I thought I answered immediately, said that they were already answered. How does that work? Do they ring a whole bunch of people at the same time and fastest answerer gets the call?
I still love the idea of this app and will keep it.",01/13/18 14:46,2

Never knew anything like this remotely existed in my whole entire life!! I’m so excited! I downloaded it last nite right after the movie and just got my 1st call from a kid that needed me to “see” for him as he was discovering his new iPhone 15. The call was less than a minute and his issue was resolved. As someone with optic neuritis (I’ve gone completely blind before) but with help of MS meds, I recovered my eyesight…at least for now….I can’t tell you guys how excited I am for this new technology!!!! I’m sobbing inside, cause if I become blind again, at least I’ll have this kind of service to help me. And as long as I can see for now, I’ll be volunteering and helping blind people as much as I can!!! Thank you app developer!!!!!!!!! May God bless you!!!!!",10/09/24 2:27,5
BlindSquare,"Unusually, this access tech is worth every penny. Not just your usual knock the customer up in the air because its niche. I often get sent to locations that are unknown to me as part of my job but Blindsquare works well with your guide dog or other mobility aid. It delivers you to the door of wherever you choose with breathtaking accuracy. My own experience is that it genuinely does deliver you to within 5 m of your destination and on the correct side - left or right. Download this-you will not be disappointed - but to the developers, please don't make the mistake of hiking the price at any point in the future :)",03/14/15 11:24,5

Be My Eyes,great idea but a pointless app.I haven't had a single call in 4 months..so it's literally just taking up space on my phone.as it does not work for anything else..too bad..,05/22/19 0:40,1
Be My Eyes,"I love this app! This is such a great use of technology! After helping a person, you'll feel really greattt!! I just received a call and I am so happy that I could help them, thank u kind people for creating such a great app may God bless u",02/17/20 6:46,5
TapTapSee,"Really brilliantly accurate, was sceptical that it would work but haven't found a failed image yet",07/14/16 2:57,5
Be My Eyes,While the AI is great there is lots of room for improvements. Things to consider for future updates. *Save the photo for future use *Save the response as a wav file for further reference. *Zoom in on the photo *Ask a question before you take the photo eg Tell me which is the container with biscuits? Rather than having to listen to everything in the photo then asking your question. *Have dark theme option and bigger font. *Have the text read aloud as soon as it appears. *Fix feedback function,12/16/23 2:22,3
Be My Eyes,"I’ve had the app installed for months as a sighted volunteer.  I’ve had four alerts - for the first three, other volunteers beat me to the call.  Today, I was finally connected with a user who needed help choosing the correct program from the touchscreen display on his elliptical machine.  It was an overwhelming experience.  I couldn’t believe how emotional I felt, given the chance to lend my sight - something I take for granted every day - to someone who lives every day without it.  This app makes use of our technological connection to other people for a truly noble purpose.  Bravo!",01/13/20 11:47,5
Seeing AI,"as a blind person I cannot begin to tell you how convenient this app makes things from identifying money,  getting cooking instructions off of products helping to identify scenes around you, I have even used it during computer issues to diagnose what’s on my screen,  it’s very stable which anyone that uses VoiceOver knows that’s saying a lot, LOL definitely a well thought out app never thought I would be able to Denna five photos the way I have even points out famous people if it recognizes them and breeds of animals to try to give you a better description of the photo awesome job thank you very much",01/25/18 16:32,5
Seeing AI,Good afternoon Seeing AI team my name is Ulises Gomez and I am giving this wonderful application. A rating of five stars. I love your application. It has helped me to scan barcodes and other things. I really enjoy this application a lot keep up the great work sincerely Ulises.,02/04/25 5:42,5
Be My Eyes,Signed up as blind. I'm visually impaired and looking forward to receiving help. Waited over 15 minutes twice and no help or connection. Needs work   Currently worthless,01/25/15 3:42,2
Be My Eyes,I live that this app allows me to actively help people in a way that is easy for them and convenient for me. Wonderful.,02/04/18 18:45,5
Be My Eyes,I’m really able to help people and that makes me feel great.,04/05/22 6:52,5
BlindSquare,I think this app can beat other more expensive paid solutions out there. This is definitely the best blindness have navigation app on iOS. Definitely my favorite.,04/28/14 15:08,5
Be My Eyes,"I think this is fantastic but I am uninstalling because I can't set hours 
or see how to get notifications without sound. I work where my ringer has 
to be off. The sound notification was loud in the sample test and I can't 
risk it going off at work or during the night while I sleep. I'll watch and 
if it's updated to where I can set availability hours I'd love to help out. 
Keep up the good work.",06/16/18 19:31,5
Be My Eyes,Who ever created this app is going to heaven! Thanks for the good deeds and for being a good human being.,11/03/17 22:25,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,Love the app works great,03/20/24 17:54,5
Be My Eyes,For the few times I actually get a call it would be great if I could change the ringtone to something super obnoxious so I surely wouldn’t miss it!  Other than that this app is amazing!,05/17/21 20:40,3
Be My Eyes,"If you're wanting to download this app to try and be able to help or do something right for once (like I did), don't. Whatever system they use to reach out to people clearly seems to favor selecting people who have successfully answered calls before. I've received (among their pointless emails talking about other people's success) one email detailing I missed a call (despite receiving no notification). And only had one call in which I stared at a 'connecting' alert for 15 minutes.",01/19/22 9:18,2

Be My Eyes,"Just got my first call from a lady needing help reading and made me feel good that I was able to help someone, after helping we talked for a bit then she lost me, I could still see and hear her but she couldn’t hear me and I didn’t see any way to get back ahold of her to see if she need more help, maybe there should be a way to reconnect if the call drops. 
Thanks for the making of this program so we can be able to help others",01/11/24 16:20,5
Be My Eyes,I was thrilled to get my first call to assist an individual. The feeling that I could be of use to someone else in need was indescribable. Great app!,02/07/22 22:02,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing! It provides a service to people that need it and gives people who wanna help a chance to do so! 5 outta 5, highly recommend.",11/10/24 3:50,5
OneStep Reader,horrible app... went to try and use it my VERY first time... and it kepy telling that I had no more texts recognitions available and to get the full version for $99.99. so it's just a scheme to get you to download the app and then try to get you to download the full version or pay for the full version immediately it's stupid,05/27/19 2:38,1
Be My Eyes,"Disclaimer: I do NOT know for sure whether this App is connected to Wangiri fraud (google it up!). But one day after I install this App, I started to receive multiple calls from overseas unknown numbers, mostly from Senegal. Just beware of the possibilities before you use the App. The intention may be good, but the possibility to harm you from bad people exploiting the App's loop holes exists !!!",04/05/20 20:33,2
Be My Eyes,"Everyone remember the point of this app is to help people who can't see.. it's not about the poor connection or if people are rude sometimes (people have bad days), it's about helping someone that's legally blind. I've only help 4 people in about 2 or 3 years but that's okay because it's not about me, it's about the people I help. Everyone should download this app! It's amazing and everyone has been so nice!",03/16/17 12:53,5
Be My Eyes,"A victim of its own success? I used to get calls almost daily even though usually they had been answered by the time I got to them. But I haven't had a call in months, so I'm uninstalling (because I need the space for other things, and I don't think it's likely I'll be getting many calls soon). A great idea, and I'm glad it's so successful!",02/10/18 19:52,5
Be My Eyes,The app is awesome. It connects the vision impaired with a volunteer that can help with everyday tasks as simple as reading a return address on an envelope to choosing between which can is the tomato soup. Whatever the need it is an amazing way for people to help people.,10/31/18 20:46,5

TapTapSee,"I am not liking to pay for pictures that I take. $10 a month is outrageous. I don't want to pay for a subscription for this app. If I looks like I will have to find a Nother identifier app that won't charge weird rates like that. did pay $10, it had better be for the app itself. Come on now.",11/07/13 7:28,1

Be My Eyes,Take some time out of our day to help the blind do day to day tasks with assistance. Blind people hopefully love it and find it useful and the blind people I’ve been working on have said that!,12/27/23 3:40,5
Seeing AI,I gave this at five stars because it’s a great app for the blind and visually impaired. But now I’m having a problem with the Seeing AI app it will not open. I depend on this app a lot for reading my mail and I am very aggravated because I cannot do that anymore. Can you please give me some suggestions on what I should do thanks.,09/21/23 13:51,5

TapTapSee,"Love this app! I use it often. It's great for phto recognition and object identification. One of my favorite apps!

Be My Eyes,I would suggest this to ANYONE!! It is such a rewarding experience.,02/27/19 18:07,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,I'd rather struggle This app will not help accurately identify anything. The AI has not learned much to be helpful. Explorer - 90% of the objects were wrongly identified. Shopping - after download the database failed to identify a can of diced tomatoes I had to uninstall the app. Very disappointing.,03/19/22 8:22,1

Envision AI,"hello envision developer, it is very sad to inform you that you have set a huge / expensive amount for using this application. you started this app for visually persons and served as a great and wonderful! but now,  this app becomes useless to use in terms of expensive amount of monthly, yearly and lifetime! so i please and please request you to reduce the price around 1000 indian rupees as a lifetime subscription. otherwise, no blind persons are ready to use this app. if you continue this price,",04/08/19 15:34,1
Be My Eyes,One app that rewards me the most.,08/13/24 2:06,5
TapTapSee,"This app is great. It's there just whe n it is needed. I would encourage the developers though, to instruct the humans or the machines or whomever or whatever is doing the reading, to always read text whenever text is present in the picture, i.e. the name of a product, the title of a book, etc.",10/19/14 12:27,5
Be My Eyes,"Dont get me wrong, i love the app!, the only reason im giving it 4 stars is because since i work in other non-profit  where your main users are also helping others, you have to create strategies that feed theses users ego, and by that i mean let them know how much they are helping so they can keep coming back for more.   I think the app needs a dashboard where i can see how many calls i answered, how many minutes i spent helping the app main users.  Otherwise is always a great pleasure to help and it´s so satisfying.!",06/20/19 10:37,4
Be My Eyes,Wonderful way of helping each other out. It's so easy and can help so much. It warms my heart. Thank you for this gift :),12/24/17 19:47,5

Be My Eyes,"The “Be My Eyes” app was brought to my attention by a family member in Chicago. I signed up the next day, and got my first call about a month later.

Be My Eyes is a wonderful app, and I’m looking forward to my next call!",10/30/20 15:24,5
OneStep Reader,One of the worst app. Playstore should be checking apps before placing on site. I just wasted a lot of data for nothing. I can't even access the app before asking for payment of a huge some of money. That's nonsense,06/18/22 2:05,1
Supersense - AI for Blind,The majority of the features this app offers work satisfactorily but for the subscription cost there are more cost effective and feature full apps… some even 100% free,03/16/25 8:02,3
TapTapSee,Unfortunately it times out on everything and will not identify anything I tried to use it to identify food products like canned food and box foods but it times out and fails on all and I was not able to do even one thing successfully. I checked my settings with the camera and the Wi-Fi connection and all is good with the device. Three other apps actually work better a barcode scanner like the one built into the Walmart app another app called seeing AI and a third one called Be My Eyes. These are all free and work very much better. I had hopes in this app and was hoping to use it as yet another resource but unfortunately it proved itself to be worthless and failed at everything so I removed it,04/25/19 14:41,1

Be My Eyes,"I am a sighted person who receives calls from blind people seeking help, and I cannot express how it fills my heart to know that even on days that I stay in my pajamas, I can be of service to another person. Even something as small (to me) as indicating the color of socks laid out in front of my screen, clearly makes an impact on the person calling. I’ve talked to lovely people and encourage more people who are no and multilingual to join. There are many times over the volunteers versus the blind, but I imagine not a huge amount with that skillset. I’d highly recommend this app, either way. It truly does make a difference for both parties and I am grateful to have been able to partake in it. Such an intelligent and awesome way to solve a problem that lifts the burden off someone who may otherwise have to seek out family or friends who aren’t right there with them.",05/11/19 18:07,5

Be My Eyes,"I had the app for a couple of years and did not get a call. I changed phones and reinstalled with a new email. It has been a little over a month and I received my first call today. I was asked to help read a prescription bottle. Truly Thrilling!! Amazing App! Amazing community! It feels so good to be a nice, helpful, kind citizen of the world. This is the laziest way to pitch in a little, every single person should have this on thier phone.....Highly Recommend!",05/08/22 16:51,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is honestly amazing. Never left a review before, but after my last call I felt obligated to do so.

Be My Eyes,Did this in less then 10 min hit there was no rush . I got my for st call within the first 3 days of downloading app,01/22/24 15:29,5
Be My Eyes,I thought this would be great to help the blind but it doesn't work properly. First I signed up to help but only got a call once and it didn't connect me. You almost never get a call as a helper because this app lies to you! When you look at the amount of helpers it will give you something like this: 179.... What that really means is there are 179 thousand helpers. I know this because I also signed up as a blind person and saw the truth there. Worst part is I made a call for help it never connected me to anybody. This app is a disgrace and should be deleted because their updates haven't fixed anything.,02/06/15 20:54,1

Be My Eyes,"Downloaded this app in JAN 2019 and have been answering calls all these years without incident. App is updated regularly and works flawlessly. There is lots of help in the app as to how to answer a call and how to help the person calling who needs assistance. I have my sight, so I am the one who receives calls to help a visually impaired person with a daily task. Calls ring my phone and if I do not pick up quickly or choose not to pick up, the call rolls over to the next volunteer. The voice connection is always clear. Early on in my volunteering, I received a call about once a month that lasted about 5 -10 minutes. Lately, I receive a call about every 4 to 6 months. I would be very happy to answer more calls. The people on the other end of the line are very appreciative of any help I can provide. Once we end the call, I feel good about the help I provide to make this persons life a bit easier.",02/23/24 16:40,5

Be My Eyes,Wholesome. No ads in the app as far as I'm aware. It's nice that there are no in-app purchases. I was able to answer one call. I wasn't too helpful because they needed computer help and I wasn't able to diagnose because I wasn't at their computer. Overall an awesome idea for an app. Thank you to the creators for using technology to help that in need rather than to just make money alone.

I am so glad I can help someone who needs help and now can not be as stressed out when it comes to something like grocery shopping, laundry, or even going to test out a new shampoo and conditioner.

One example is it recognized a Ferris wheel it’s said wheel, Ferris wheel, tourist attraction. It also said people waiting for the bus at night.

I’m updating my update tonight. I discovered that this app can describe videos. But the video has to be two minutes or less. The five minute mark is too large for the video. And it can only give you 10 videos per day. But if you delete the app and start over, you can do as many videos as you want. can you please fix that so the videos can be more than five minutes? thank you.",11/02/24 1:22,1

I've been able to read vending machine info,  My t-shirts,  train station signs and info,  and train numbers on the train as it is pulling into the station. 

The app easily reads touch screens  and button panels,.  There now needs to be a way to match button text with a particular button on the panel.  This is easier with a large vending machine,  harder with an appliance such as a radio or washing machine.  

If someone wears glasses they have to put their picture in twice with and without the glasses. 

It would be awesome if the sceens app could report relavent information such as an empty seat,  trash can, vending machine,  all the things you want to find when using public transportation and facilities.",08/18/17 9:44,5

Seeing AI,Absolutely love this app! Didn’t even think there was apps out here like this until today when I was on the phone with a friend. She told me that some of her friends use it and I had never heard of it. Only problem I have is with the face recognition… The age it gives you in face descriptions is way off. For example I  used a photo of my boyfriend earlier that was in my camera roll and had it describe the photo. It said he was 35 based on facial looks. I might not see very well but I know my boyfriend is only 23 and doesn’t look nowhere near that old… That need some improving other than that the app is amazing! Thank you!,02/15/18 2:07,4

Lookout - Assisted vision,"So far you violated your own ACCESSIBILITY ♿ OPTIONS AVAILABILITY. YOUR VIDEO HAS A BUTTON TO USE FULL SCREEN, BUT YOU HAVE A PANEL THAT TAKES HALF OF THE SCREEN PREVENTING THE VIDEO FROM GOING FULL SCREEN.

Be My Eyes,This is such an amazing app. Why not give a few minutes to help someone when you can? Do it.,06/03/19 19:27,5
Be My Eyes,so I've had this app on my phone for about 3 years and I have NEVER received a call. I'm one of those horrible people that always has my phone in my hand so I figured this is great. Except that whatever algorithm this app uses doesn't work right. My coworker downloaded the app and got over 10 calls in less than 4 months. I love the concept but you need to fix the call distribution system.,07/05/19 17:36,1

A nice lady called needing help identifying her mail ordered medications. After I help her she was so gracious and said some nice things that made me a bit misty eyed. Just a few mins of my time saved her an embarrassing trip to the local civic center. We can take so many things for granted, and this service reminds me to be thankful for the simple things. I’m thankful for my sight and that I can use it to help others. Hope you choose to do the same :)",10/07/19 23:47,5

The only Two issues I am currently experiencing with the app are that I am not exactly pleased with the subscription model… I would have rather paid $200 for the life of the app. But, I am willing to pay the subscription because the app is worth it. The other thing I would like to see implemented in this app is public transportation directions for those of us Who live in larger cities that make use of public transportation. It would be amazing if this app could announce all of the stops as the bus/train approaches and Provide the next few times that the vehicle will come to your stop while you are waiting.",07/02/13 8:23,4

Just tap on notification which open the  call straight away but got the meat again someone else already get the call. How? I have iPhone 12 Pro Max so Al this thing was less than 4 seconds!! I Tory understand they need help it’s a really good app and if they can’t ring me for 1 min as if other 2 people not answering wasted 3 min. But t c’mon at least 10 seconds it’s not a big deal.,09/17/22 19:52,2
Be My Eyes,Hello - this app is about helping people. Giving a poor review because you have not gotten a call is crazy! Really? Or a poor review because the app wants information on you and your smart phone. Really?? Having a disability makes you a little more concerned about your safety. Hopefully the app is using the info to weed out the crazies! Sign up because you want to help NOT because you want to brag to your friends.,01/27/15 15:42,5

I wish there was a podcast on demonstrating or how to use this app. I think people would agree to pay the high cost if they could see or hear a demonstration of its use. That would even help me since I have purchased the app and still don’t know how to use it. that would drive up your sales, and help me at the same time. for example, instructions on how to use it, what you can use it to do, etc.",03/07/19 4:33,3

 I love several of the channels that this app provides. The product, document and short text are great. The document channel especially is great. I purchase another app a while back for $100 and this app works better. I love that I do not have to presss a button to take the picture. 
I found the person channel fun, but not very useful. I do not find the color channel accurate. I have better success with tap tap See for colors. I used the color channel on a white shirt and when it was on the sleeves it would say grey and on the front or back of the shirt it would say brown.

The relatively new AI feature is truly amazing and everybody needs to learn how to use it effectively. That’s sad on the occasions. I’ve had trouble reaching Volunteer in a timely manner. The AI feature has worked really well to guide me.

My only suggestion is that they remove the comment section after a session has ended as I’ve had almost 0 problems with  it. It would be better just to have the option to submit a report if anyone needs to rather than being forced to by having to complete it by selecting I had problems or I had a good session.",02/19/25 20:08,5

I've answered a dozen or so calls since I've had the app (for about a year and a half now) and sometimes it is REALLY difficult to answer the questions being asked because the video is too blurry, pixilated, or freezes up. A couple times it froze and an error message popped up saying that there was a problem and I was going to be disconnected. It's just so disappointing when that happens. I'd love to be able to answer what's asked with more confidence, but this app needs better video quality for that to happen.

Lookout - Assisted vision,It's a good app but I can't get it to the homepage. I have to open play store when I want to read something,01/25/24 12:37,5
Be My Eyes,"Brilliant way to make a difference, helping to empower others to be so much more independent.   My app had offloaded. On downloading I got a call immediately so I assumed it was the training video. It was an actual call - a lady trying to find her medicine cabinet after decorators had moved it. Used the torch button.  One box was items for her guide dog.  We puppy raised guide dogs!",01/30/25 2:01,5
Be My Eyes,"If u don't give five stars to this app, you can't give 5 stars to any other app. It's helping a lot of people. It's an amazing feeling to help someone in need.

Blind Explorer,"I couldn't get past the on-boarding accouint definition. The UI doesn't check for my system UI settings and presents the initial screens in a bright color scheme. I'm photophobic and require dark mode UIs. Come on, you are an app for the blind and visually impaired. You should be sensitive to this sort of thing. Additionally you can't create anncount without agreeing to get email newsletters and other notifications. That's unacceptable.",11/23/24 15:01,1

Be My Eyes,"Just had my first call today to help someone who is visually impaired via ""Be My Eyes"". There are so many volunteers on the app, I never thought my help would be needed, but oh my heart I loved being able to help. 🥰",10/31/21 21:16,5
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for a couple of weeks now, and I just received my first call. It was awesome! I work with a blind person, so this seemed like a great way to help. It's not hard, and there isn't an issue with privacy. The other person just asks a question and you answer to the best of your ability. Other have complained about the video, but mine worked perfectly. Thank you for this app!",02/24/15 21:14,5

E. 1st Street right side, W. 1st St. left side or something like that. I would love to see this in Blind Square. Browsing the reviews I see others asking for this as well, so it would be quite a welcome feature. Thank you.",04/16/21 14:20,4

Be My Eyes,Hello I’m a volunteer and I can think of a way to make this app better for the vollenters who can’t answer at times. Why not include a new feature where you can pause the app so you don’t get notifications. I can’t answer when I’m at school and knowing that there are people I could be helping when I can’t gets me unfocused and sad that I can’t help:( I would love to see this implemented in to this wonderful app! Chaio,01/02/20 8:28,4
Be My Eyes,"To all the people rating it so low because they don’t get calls. Do you realize it’s 100,000 blind people & over 2million volunteers?! Your call will come, just be patient! 

I LOVE this app! I enjoy helping people & listening to them & talking to them. I’ve counted money, helped ride trains, picked out outfits, fixed computers, changed thermostats, read letters, organized clothes, sorted through old mail, & so much more! It’s always my pleasure to assist! 

I have gotten an iffy phone call before where the person was more trying to date me & then even slipped up & disclosed he was actually blind 🤦🏾‍♀️.. I wish it was a better screening for that.",07/17/19 0:46,5
Be My Eyes,"This is one of the easiest ways to help others! Most calls are under a minute, but if neither of you is in a hurry, it can go longer. I helped a gal pair up matching outfits the other day and my husband just helped someone who was cooking. It’s fun and easy and so worth it!!",11/29/21 15:35,5
Be My Eyes,Thank you for doing this for everyone,12/04/23 1:26,5

Be My Eyes,What a great app. 👍,03/12/24 3:33,4
Be My Eyes,I started using this app recently as a volunteer and I believe it's one of the greatest apps on the App Store. It allows you to help others in need anytime and anywhere. God bless the creators of this app for this wonderful service they've provided for those who really need it!,08/13/18 10:28,5
Be My Eyes,I'm excitedly waiting for my first call.,05/23/18 1:05,5

Be My Eyes,"App is super user friendly. There's absolutely no guilt if you miss a call or can't take it...someone else will help. Love that it's an easy way to help others. My only complaint is I selfishly wish i got more calls haha but there's enough users that they're few and far between (which means no one has to wait too long for help) but i always smile when I do get a call. It's just nice to see technology help people in such a simple, positive, way.",11/03/21 0:10,5
Be My Eyes,Such a great way to help people,06/12/18 2:13,5
Be My Eyes,I think this app is amazing for everything. I see a lot of reviews saying there’s not a lot of calls even when they clicked immediately but I just think that you should be happy that a person is getting help as quick as they could if they asked someone near them.,04/09/20 7:41,5

Seeing AI,I am a person with a visual impairment and sometimes struggle to see faces or read text. I tried the “person” feature on my parents and it was pretty close in age and facial expression. Highly recommend this app to any people with a visual impairment!!!,06/08/20 6:53,5
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,I think Lazarillo is a wonderful app. It tells you everything you want to know. It even surprises you with information you hadn't realized you hadn't known before.,12/23/18 10:36,5
Envision AI,Finally! an app that does what it said it's supposed to do it actually reads the products both in voice and printed text thank you very much,09/08/18 11:27,5
Be My Eyes,It would be good if there was an option to select the hours that you are available to answer. Half the time I miss calls because I'm in the middle of something.,01/12/22 14:05,4
Be My Eyes,Good concept if it is real,10/06/17 7:54,5
Be My Eyes,Awesome app,11/24/20 20:01,5
Seeing AI,I am a completely blind user of this app. I love the app 😊 I use it with voice over the screen mirror on Apple products with my iPhone. The only problem that I am seeing is it does not do a good job when you try to use it with those 2 L bottles of pop that people get Voice is not reading me any of the information the camera isn’t working and whether I use the short text or document mode it doesn’t work and doesn’t help and also voiceover is having trouble. It doesn’t say hold steady every time to know the cameras in the right place and lined up it’s not telling me every single time I think it’s a bug please fix all this if you can and add another mood for reading labels on 2 L bottles of pop. Thank you.,01/31/24 4:35,4
Be My Eyes,"Amazing app, it really helps people and I'm ready to help.",07/10/18 15:27,5
Be My Eyes,"What a wonderful idea. Just used it for the first time: took no time to connect. Couldn't find the thing I dropped but at least I feel better that if we both couldn't see it, it isn't just me. it's definitely hiding! I wish all health professionals and charities and other organisations knew Be My Eyes, to suggest to people. When I've given a few tries (I'm cautious about recommending to others), then I'll be spreading the word. Just wish I could volunteer. Thank you for this service!",04/29/24 13:10,5

Be My Eyes,"I was really excited when I found this app, I really wanted to volunteer. When I try sign up (not matter which way) it’s says “error timed out” 
For the last 2 hours..... probably will have to delete 
It’s a great concept but if you can’t even sign up it’s kinda a waste of an app no?",08/27/20 17:37,1
Be My Eyes,I like this i would love to help people it would be an honor,05/17/18 17:28,5
Be My Eyes,What a great app! I heard about a friend who used it to help a blind person read what the temperature was in her house. I just helped someone who needed help resetting her satellite dish after a power failure.  This app is truly a great use of technology!,02/28/19 3:02,5
Be My Eyes,Omg thanks to whomever created this app!!,06/08/18 20:28,5
Be My Eyes,Helping people always 5 stars,03/12/21 14:45,5
Be My Eyes,"In and of itself, the app works as it should and I’ve never had a problem.

Overall though, it’s always so satisfying when I get a call. If you’re just checking this out, adjust your expectations as you probably won’t get a lot of calls. I’ve had this app for  several years and I receive maybe three or four calls a year. But when I do, I always have a sense of satisfaction afterwards!!",07/21/24 9:47,5
Be My Eyes,"What a great way to help people.  Leaves a warm fuzzy feeling and it is absolutely free…!

Fantastic.",11/14/21 12:52,5
Seeing AI,"I am truly amazed with this app and the many embedded options.  Most free or minimal cost apps don't have consistent OCR identification accuracy, however this app puts most if not all which fall in the afore mentioned category to shame.  It is greatly appreciated.  Two things I would recommend is a text size control and a highlight rectangle when reading for those with low vision.  Great job Microsoft, I look forward to seeing new revisions of the software in the future.",07/15/17 21:48,5
Be My Eyes,"The volunteers are great, and most helpful thing that they do. The app is wonderful, a life-changing app for those of us that need some help from time to time. Thank you much for creating the app and the network.

Be My Eyes,"Amazing Concept I find this concept really amazing. However my phone is on vibrate 90% of the time and calls don't vibrate on this. It would be good if it showed a notification during a call as they can be used by many as a trigger for different actions. It would also be good to be asked to choose availability hours, so that the volunteers don't have to remember to enable notifications when available.",06/02/22 12:22,4
Be My Eyes,A great help for those in need,05/03/19 0:11,5
Be My Eyes,"Describe my experience, ok. Non existant downloaded the app over 3 months ago, no point keeping it if the joy i would get by helping someone doesn't come, shame",07/31/23 18:08,1
Be My Eyes,"I've been a helper since 2018, but unfortunately had not been able to answer many calls. Today while reactivating the app on my new phone I immediately received a call. The video and audio quality isn't amazing (could have been the cell network) but with careful communication we were able to successfully get what we needed done. Complaints on quality cannot be immediately blamed on the app, as different areas have different service speeds and qualities.",07/06/21 13:25,5

Be My Eyes,Yes I’m so so so happy to help. Unfortunately my very 1st call didn’t come all the way through I had music playing and somehow while trying to stop that music I closed the call before being able to answer.

It would be nice, if there would be a way that you could use the USB port to link up to freedom scientific‘s jaws and use it as an OCR device. It would be a way cheaper, and far more accurate Version of the purl camera that ships with openbook or any other program that freedom scientific ships.

Hopefully that doesn’t ding me for future assistance. This is so easy to help blind or limited sight individuals with tasks sighted people take for granted. At work I have to assist people in person regularly and many don’t know about this app. I’ll continue to tell people about this now that I received a call and know it’s real and being used.",07/29/24 17:09,5

Be My Eyes,"Wow! This is Amazing. 

The love of my life recommended I download the  -Be My Eyes- app on 07/25/2022 after another one of my rants about wanting to help more humans. One day later, 07/26/2022 (my guys exact bday) and I received my first call on the way to his birthday dinner in Long Beach. Boy, were we in for a Treat! 🍬 

I promptly answered and on the line was a easy going gentle manwith a warm and contagious smile. 😁 I was excited to hear of the task. How May I serve or assist you, sir? What is the task at hand?  He wanted me to explain what was happening on the television screen 📺 before him. I was delighted to play this part. 

Let’s get me a little closer to the TV. Perfect! 
What was he watching? America’s Got Talent! What was the act? A young international yo-yo 🪀 dancing pro! Delicious! (in my AbrahamHicks voice) This talented young act is Spectacular! He paraded across the stage dancing 🕺 and flipping with the yo-yos never breaking their stride. The crowd went wild! The judges were floored! I described each twirl and flair with enthusiasm! 

We all laughed in delight, my boyfriend included.
After that act, the tone was set. We hardly wanted to end this scene. He gave us some great words and we genuinely indulged in the feeling of being alive. His energy, amazing. It felt like winning a million dollars or talking to a good friend after a long time. I love this app. We wait patiently for our next call. There are no strangers here, just feels like a friend helping a friend. Faith in humanity restored. 💫✨ The Blind Man at a yo-yo show.

Funny story: We just got the ticket in the mail 08/08/2022 from East Los Angeles Police Department for running a red light 🚦during this moment of amazement. Stay safe, stay conscious This is our story 💓✨Namaste. 

Peace, love & light to you forever,

 to the man we laughed and shared with but who never saw our face. You are beautiful sir. We hope you will receive this message somehow.

Be My Eyes,"It's interesting, but if you don't answer within the first few seconds someone else get it. It's like they send a call to everyone in the app at the same time to answer. Had a guy call me that I'm unsure was visually impaired though, seems like he just wanted to talk to me about my personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Did not appreciate being hijacked by a witness when trying to help people. Other than that it's been cool!",08/03/21 7:42,4
Be My Eyes,"It is really overwhelming that the producer of this app thinks about the sake of blind people... Besides on the bad people in the world, there are still good people that can help the most. Especially people with disabilities...

Then I thought I might take a screen shot of my Messages and have that read out to me.... no. Also, there is no Help Site, so I am stuck! (Yes, there is help info, but it's very limited and has no search function. One star for now, but if the developers can instruct me I will give more",04/10/25 11:21,1

Envision AI,"Thank you for this great app. It's even better than seeing AI. Keep up your great job.
It reads the computer screen very well, very useful to us when there's no screen reader available. It would be great to make the app detect the item or the option under the curser.
It will be great to control which languages it should read. Sometimes it reads languages other than the language displayed. i.e. it fails to recognize the correct language.
It is great that it recognizes Arabic, but the quality needs to improve more and more, because sometimes the text is clear but the app fails to recognize the correct letter.",09/05/19 12:34,5

However in the last 3 times, curiously all 3 in the last 10 days, the call/connection lasted only a few seconds and then the calls dropped. I only got to say hi but unfortunately I couldn't give any help. My only guess is that the connection to Internet is poor or that the app is having trouble maintaining the call. Overall I think this is a great tool to give some little help to blind people.",02/27/17 23:20,3

I also was looking at wrinkled papers in the car on my lap and the ocr was almost perfect.

Unfortunately, getting it to work is a bit of a challenge. First, the field of view report does not give consistent information. I’ve run the report multiple times in the same position and get different results each time. Additionally, sometimes the field report fails to give voice feedback, and you have to dismiss the app and relaunch.

When performing OCR, you often only get portions of the text; this even occurs when the field report indicates that alignment is perfect. Just as in the field report, OCR often fails to provide voice output.

She was really appreciative and getting to help someone I dont know with something I take for granted literally made me tear up after. Thats what I remember most.",07/31/20 7:51,5

Be My Eyes,I gave this app a four star rating. I did this because it would've had five stars if the app would have better connectivity when it comes to a cited part or I said helper. The app wait forever before finally connecting you to someone to help you. It takes at least 2 to 3 minutes before you get someone but when you do get people there very kind very gracious and they do help. The app has no accessibility issues other than that. They're definitely does need to be a better connectivity system so that is soon as you press that button you got somebody Who is sort of loans their eyes to you for a few minutes and help you with whatever task you need. It very much would help though if it was faster when it comes to connectivity this app would've gotten a five star rating would it have been this way. The only reason for me that it got a four star rating was because of the connectivity problem.,09/05/15 12:15,4
TapTapSee,It helps me with so many things from knowing which medicine is which to helping me with food and mail. It helps with so many thing and gives me a idea of what I’m looking at from what it is to what color it is.

Be My Eyes,Amazing app that provides a valuable service!,02/05/24 17:53,5
Be My Eyes,"Hi guys, I love the idea behind this app, but I have 2 things to add as feedback, hope this helps you: i) I've never been able to answer a single call, as it disconnects as soon as it rings, and; ii) lately the app is constantly popping up whilst I'm in the middle of using other apps, typing messages on WhatsApp, using Spotify, etc. It's really rather annoying, and it keeps re-opening even after I've shut it. Thanks for all the hard work though, good luck! :)",10/23/19 2:33,3

OneStep Reader,I can't rightfully give this app less stars due to cost..its amazing! I'm Dyslexic and returning to school for my masters! I wish it were more cost effective for students but that does not take away from the use or the great help this app has already been on free trial..ALL Dyslexics should have this! I don't know if unlocking the full app will allow me to change the voice but I hope it can. If not please add feature for more ease of understanding and reading pleasure! Thank you for this app! Wow just WOW.,02/16/16 18:58,5
TapTapSee,"I love this app. It really is amazing! It can help me by distinguishing colors of socks, shirts, or pants, it can read dollar bills, it can tell what an item is without having to look at a barcode scanner, and it can read text on paper. This is everything I need, bundled in one package. Thank you for this wonderful app. The only problem is that it costs money for taking pictures and for me this is a really big setback but other than that this app is great",10/24/15 7:27,4

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Quick read mode is amazing. Point it at a book or sign and it reads it out loud. Explore mode is not as accurate and a little slow, but still a remarkable technology.

Be My Eyes,Nice concept. Received my first call felt a little fishy. Guy was in a room (looked like a bedroom) and was asking for help finding the door. Got up out of bed and fell dramatically. Ended up helping him locate door and handle. Hope he really needed help but felt more like a prank.,07/16/19 12:52,3

I loved the experience and I'm looking forwards to help more people.The app is pretty simple and straightforward, as it should be.

It's so nice to make some difference on people's lives, as little as it may seem. Be My Eyes is a must-have.",12/10/20 8:41,5

I have helped read directions on food, identify food from a freezer, read icons on a computer screen and a few other simple tasks. Sometimes I talk to the people for a few minutes also, sometimes it is quick and we are done. The people cannot see me and I can only see what they show me. I have never had a problem with audio or camera. We have always had good connections. I like meeting people from different places and being helpful when I can. It's a great app!",01/31/17 22:49,5

OneStep Reader,Horrible. What happened to this app? For some reason I cannot change the English voice to anything but Fred. I am not impressed with the new user interface either. I can use it however it is not as straightforward as it use to be. it just seems cluttered. I agree with other reviewers  that   saving files and importing them is needlessly  more  complicated. My biggest complaint with this app is the fact that I can only use Fred using English. There is no way I would pay full price for this app now.,11/11/18 16:56,1

A few days ago I answered a call to help someone when I was having a moment (mourning my father’s passing) and that call came at the right time.

Be My Eyes,I saw this app on a news story and knew that it was something I would love to do.  The thought of helping someone just by answering my phone seemed great.  I have been a part of Be My Eyes for a few years and have been able to help people in my my small way.  Definitely worth the download.,03/07/17 15:43,5
TapTapSee,"This app works incredibly well. It is amazing how many items  it can identify almost instantaneously even on older hardware. I believe I find the most use with this app at identifying cans of food which are almost impossible to identify with other  more expensive software such as knfb reader. I find that this app alongside  moneyreader and knfb  reader provide  of the identification and reading that I need to function completely independently. So why is this app yummy? Because without it I wouldn't know which can of soup I was opening.🍴🍜 I wholeheartedly recommend this application alongside cayenne FB reader and money reader as three absolute must have applications. If I could change anything about the app, would add a history that you could review after you reopen the app of the last four pictures. Notification of when the lens is covered or otherwise unable to get a picture before the picture is sent for processing. This would save time for the user and same time for those who must've been the find the pictures. Thanks for a great app!",11/02/15 19:26,5
Seeing AI,It would be really cool if we could use facial recognition with Photos we already have. I don’t see my family a lot so they send me pictures and I have no way to put in facial recognition because they’re not here to take the picture themselves.,09/14/18 8:45,5

Be My Eyes,"Wouldn't recommend, never worked for me. Always fake rings and never real calls. I'm skeptic about the app, just might read info. Not for me, I've had it over 2 years and never a real call. Its disappointing because I have 3 direct family members with severe disabilities and I was always eager to help others but today my patience for this app ended. I will delete as it just isn't worth it. I thought the idea behind an app like this would be marvelous but it never worked for me.",07/23/22 14:11,1

Be My Eyes,"This app has a wonderful point and seems very helpful to those in need. I just with I could be more of assistance in helping. I never get calls to help people, probably because there are over 1 million people here to assist those in need of visual help. But what percentage of people wanting to help still want to help. Is there a way to see who’s actually helping and get rid of the others? This disappoints me.",12/24/20 3:32,3

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,Such a wonderful app I have ever seen of maps category thanks to developerto make this useful app for visually impaired person,10/03/19 0:28,5
Be My Eyes,"What a great app and way to help those with sight impairment or loss. Often a case of ‘fastest finger first’ when it comes to helping and I’ve not been fast enough yet. But I’m happy in the knowledge that if I’m not getting back fast enough that the person seeking assistance has got help quickly.

Another key thing this app demonstrates is that there are many people in the world that are happy to help others without payment and hence there are still good people out there - despite the frequent feeling the world is a selfish place. Gives you some faith in the world!

As a suggestion for another way to help others how about developing a ’loneliness app’ for older people who would like a chat with someone? Loneliness in older people is a big issue and I’d be more than happy to spend time having a chat with someone who is feeling isolated out there. Obviously safeguards would be needed but I’m sure you get the idea. I’d do it myself but haven’t a clue how to write apps! 

Well done to the developers, kudos!",08/28/18 12:35,5

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted helper it was easy to set up.

My blind friend Albert signed up but there is no option to choose a helper by rating or to set someone as their favorite so to call the same person again is impossible. Every call is to a random person.

It would be better to have a fav list and join up with the same persons or group of persons that we are familiar with from a previous call help building trust. 

Also need a personality profile for who you are talking to. Maybe a sound byte to hear their voice or choose a man or woman or age of helper or location to help with local needs.",02/01/15 22:01,3

Seeing AI,"This app makes my life much easier. While not being totally blind but with about 5% vision I can still see the little icons in the bottom. Haven’t used everything yet but the short text, document reader, currency, and color has come in very handy. You know you don’t want to look silly and where mismatch clothes lol.

So I just use the product tab and figured out there was another icon that it would read me more information. The short text doesn’t always read the instructions well for heating but the extra product info gave me all the information I needed. This app matched with my Alexa microwave/oven/air fryer is going to be absolutely marvelous together. Thank you for this app and thank you for continuing to update it.",10/14/21 6:28,5

TapTapSee,"This app is precisely the sort of thing that could only happen because iOS is accessible. It allows a great deal of independence, and has only become more accurate with its identification as time passes. It's very lightweight, but I appreciate the features it does have… Particularly access to the photo Library, for identifying my paltry efforts now and again. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, especially considering it's price.",07/12/14 10:28,5

It was a miracle! And the problem was solved in minutes. So happy to help. Very gratifying!",06/23/18 3:47,5
Be My Eyes,I hope someone's sees this I've been using the app for a little while and only had 1 call so far but the call I had did have some issues with connecting our cameras it just stayed loading and when I tried to send feedback through the app It uses the send feedback option as a share button like I'm trying to send the feedback to and app or other or contacts on my phone.

Be My Eyes,I think and know that people are using this app to steal people's information and I don't think that is a good look for your company so I think this app should be deleted and as in my sincere truth and it is the truth and only the truth because I've had it happen people in my family,03/07/24 14:00,1
Be My Eyes,"I found this little app one day a few years ago, and thought what a nice little thing I can do to help others. Turns out this is one of the biggest things I do for me.  I’m always so amazed as to how truly appreciative the people you help are.  It could be just a simple thing like which shirt is the yellow one, to helping someone finish updating their computer.  I always feel like it may have been just a little thing to them, but for me I’m certain I’m the big winner when the call is over.",09/27/20 14:31,5

I had the good fortune of assisting a user today and the feeling was tremendous. My first call came today during my Dr visit for a damaged knee and whilst sitting in the office grimacing in pain, stressed and thinking why me, the call came through and at that moment I was reminded to count my blessings. We want more of these apps please, as both users and volunteers would be able to benefit in a positive way 😊.",02/26/18 8:27,5

It would be nice, if there would be a way that you could use the USB port to link up to freedom scientific‘s jaws and use it as an OCR device. It would be a way cheaper, and far more accurate Version of the purl camera that ships with openbook or any other program that freedom scientific ships. More people with Windows PC’s use jaws, than any other screen reader such as narrator, NVDA, system access, or any other windows screen reader. Thanks.",10/06/19 19:03,5

Truly beautiful and unadulterated. There is no money grab. There is no status. There is nothing but an opportunity to help someone that can never return the favor. An opportunity to just do something good for a fellow human. 

It’s pure. It’s amazing. It is something that gives me hope for humanity. 

Every time I have received a call I cry tears of joy after.

Be My Eyes,"An awesome and useful app! Works great! I encourage anyone who is willing to do some helping, or needs some help, to download and use it. Waited about a month for the first call, but I am glad I could help. Funny fact: the first call came from the visually impaired friend that told me about the app in the first place. Huh ... what were the odds of that? :D",03/04/18 5:39,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the option to turn on the caller’s flashlight.  It’s very helpful for those of us who accommodate ourselves with lamps and overhead lights!  
I wish I knew whether it automatically shuts off again when the call ends...?  That’s been bugging me because it can really zap a person’s battery if they don’t realize the torch is still on.  Does it shut off again?",10/29/20 10:20,5
Be My Eyes,Being able to do what I can when someone else could use a set of eyes for a moment is great! Everyone should try it. I’d love to help all day long if I had time! So satisfying and meaningful. I’ve got a buzz from helping a stranger! Great convo.,03/26/19 20:22,5

Seeing AI,"I would recommend this app to anyone who is completely blind, or low vision like me. The best parts of this app for me are it’s ability to read short text on the fly, or capture entire documents in just a few seconds. This app rivals paid apps like DigitEyes and KNFBReader. I can’t speak for KNFBReader as I don’t own that app, but SeeingAI, in my experience, detects products just as good or even better than DigitEyes, as for it’s recognition of text on paper or a computer screen, I’ve not had any complaints about it. Things that need improvement are the money reader, scene recognition, and color recognition. Those features are relatively new, so I expect them to improve with updates. The app gets a five star recommendation from me, for anyone with even a slight visual impairment.",04/20/18 0:45,5

The only thing I’d like to change is the ringtone, for how high my phone volume can be, it’s still very not strong and you can easily get the call too late or miss it completely, especially when there are other noises around me like TV, music or I’m in the street with the phone in my pocket.
Overall it’s a great idea and app, people that I answered to have always been very sweet.",03/04/21 3:17,5
Be My Eyes,How is a blind person suppose to take the picture and type?,01/16/15 23:27,1
Be My Eyes,Please be very aware if you were thinking about downloading  this app that they use language which I feel is degrading to blind  people. Also often when you do use the app it just rings and rings for ages and   doesn’t always connect you to anybody. I think there  are better apps that do the same thing and they give you much more control over what is happening. I disagree with the new stories tab as it talks about blind people in language I feel is degrading  such as heartwarming and inspirational. I think this is very infantilising and disrespectful especially as the primary base using this app will be people who want to live their life as independently as possible.,03/23/18 22:35,1

This app has helped ppl do simple things that you overlook. Simple tasks can be hard and it’s not easy asking for help. Be that person that can help someone who has the courage to ask for help. I joined in 2019. I keep the app and forget about it until a call comes in and when a call does come that becomes my priority at that time. I even had my husband look up fan manual to help that one person with his fan temp while I was on the phone. It’s not an everyday thing but you taking the time to help means everything to someone.

Seeing AI,"I just downloaded this app, and so far, I’m really impressed with its functionality. Please keep it going! I’m not blind, nor is my dad, who I actually downloaded it for. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, which causes hallucinations, making it difficult for him to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. He once mentioned that he wished he could point his phone at something and have it tell him whether it was real. That led me to search for apps, and I came across this one.

We plan to use it during his episodes—either he can use his phone himself, or we, as caregivers, can assist him—so he can have confirmation of reality. I’m especially impressed with the describe feature and how detailed it is in explaining what’s being seen. So far, I’m really happy with it. Keep up the great work!",02/05/25 20:00,5
Be My Eyes,I love being a part of the Be My Eyes App community. I have taken a good handful of calls and helped so many wonderful people accomplish their tasks. I plan to be a volunteer for Be My Eyes for as long as this solution is offered to the world.,02/18/23 0:17,5

Be My Eyes,This is such a useful application - I used it for the first time and the volunteer was very courteous and seemed genuinely eager to assist. This app was such a clever idea but maybe consider opening it up to a broader spectrum of disabilities. Thank you for finally releasing this on Android!,10/10/17 2:25,5

TapTapSee,"I was originally looking for a barcode reader, that I could use in conjunction with TalkBack. This works almost as well. When it cannot read the labels of what you are trying to scan, it does its best to describe the item under the camera lens, so that you can determine what you are asking it to see. I really love this app!",11/07/16 0:48,5

TapTapSee,"In researching Apps for the visually impaired I came across this app which totally blew me away! It recognized the picture I took as ""burgundy paisley sofa"" well that's about as close a description of my sofa as one could make from a picture! Kudos to the developers. I can see how this app would make a huge difference!!",07/25/13 13:16,5
Be My Eyes,"I figured out that you have to align the camera with the object in question. Be my Eyes is very helpful. I recomend this app for blind users who need to know what color things are, what type of food something is, or what a sign says. Be my eyes simply uses kind volinteers to help blind users figure out what they need to know. So, I think Be my eyes is a great app.",03/09/20 7:14,5
OneStep Reader,"I would happily pay $99 for the application that I'm looking for, but this is not it. I was hoping that I would be able to use this to read historical SEC filings of companies which include a lot of text and tables. Unfortunately, as their instructional material explains, Advance documents like memos in books are only intended for the cited users, while blind people are only supposed to read receipts. 

Even though it says that you can export to HTML, the only options for saving are PDF and some sort of proprietary format which they recommend for blind people. The only way that you can actually read is by using the audio player tool, as voiceover Will only navigate word by word. You can also only read by sentence, word or line, and not by paragraph. During the OCR process, voiceover will not interact with the application and it does not tell you the progress.

Be My Eyes,"I recently downloaded this app to volunteer and it’s great! I got my first notification today and there is no pressure to answer if you are unable to, but luckily I was available and the first to take the call! I was on my call for probably less than a minute, but it felt great to know that I made a difference in this person’s day. There is barely any commitment and it will not get in the way of your day at all, but it will make the day much easier for somebody else.",11/17/18 2:46,5
TapTapSee,Great,06/19/16 6:49,4
Be My Eyes,This is a great use of technology. Had my first call two days ago. It was someone needing help reading the numbers on the back of some gift cards. Directed her how to move them around and how to position her camera so I could read them. She was very nice and patient and I was happy I could help someone. This is a great way to use technology to help others,10/25/23 6:32,5
Be My Eyes,I’ve been using this app to help people for the past two years and it’s been such a great way to help people! I usually just help them indentify objects they have and they’re super quick calls! I’ve always dealt with incredibly kind and considerate people so it really makes me happy I can help out.,08/17/23 23:13,5

Seeing Assistant Move,All I wish for is to add a talking compass to the app,02/28/20 6:28,5
Be My Eyes,"The app is a great idea, but lacks essential features. There is no available/busy status. Can only go offline by logging out. It is pointless to contact someone who's unavailable. I recommend a 3 status system. On call ( prioritize to me), available (regular priority), busy (no call requests). I recommend creating PC version, perhaps a web portal. Computer screens are better for video and better assitance could be provided. Perhaps have an volunteer operator style setup option.",12/23/19 20:11,4
Be My Eyes,"If you’re like me, you find yourself trying to find ways to help others without drawing attention to yourself. It’s about the giving, not the accolades for giving. 

Be My Eyes allows me to spend a few minutes helping someone. Sometimes people just need a tiny bit of help. I helped a woman this week determine whether the light in a room was on or off. Simple. Helpful. 

I strongly encourage people to participate!",09/05/19 14:09,5

Be My Eyes,"Thank you for allowing me to share my sight. It’s such a privilege ♥️
Also, I have a request. Under stories, I realized that all the people have countries listed for them, however, “Africa” is used very carelessly. 
We honestly can’t be having these conversations in 2018, Africa is a continent. Just as someone is from Canada, Africa has 50+ countries. Please correct this. Otherwise, great app.",09/18/18 0:27,4

Be My Eyes,I love that this app has taken our technology which we become glued to and provides a way to give back to others.,10/07/19 23:22,5
Be My Eyes,This app makes it so much easier to reach out for help. We all get stuck in our day-to-day lives and I can only imagine how much of a peace of mind this app provides to the blind in our community. Best app on my phone.,02/12/19 16:15,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This app is convenient, but not essential. In Jan ‘25 it just recently changed to a subscription model. However I can’t find any information about pricing on their website or in their app description. In any event, the app was good, But certainly not worth a subscription model. You guys have to realize it’s the kiss of death to offer subscriptions in this community. If you can’t find grants or other ways to fund your app, give up and put it up on GitHub as open source and move on to something else. Hope you are ready to be roasted on all the podcasts out there. And I don’t buy your model needs to be updated frequently. Traffic signals don’t change in the United States regularly because of the expense, the AI model is good enough for now. Sorry you don’t understand that having an app like this is not essential it’s a convenience and your subscription is simply not worth it. Before you run out of funds and turn off the lights for the last time, I hope you do make it open sore so others can contribute to the work you started.",01/15/25 20:58,2

Seeing AI,"I would recommend this app to anyone who is completely blind, or low vision like me. The best parts of this app for me are it’s ability to read short text on the fly, or capture entire documents in just a few seconds. This app rivals paid apps like DigitEyes and KNFBReader. I can’t speak for KNFBReader as I don’t own that app, but SeeingAI, in my experience, detects products just as good or even better than DigitEyes, as for it’s recognition of text on paper or a computer screen, I’ve not had any complaints about it. Things that need improvement are the money reader, scene recognition, and color recognition. Those features are relatively new, so I expect them to improve with updates. The app gets a five star recommendation from me, for anyone with even a slight visual impairment.",04/19/18 17:45,5

OneStep Reader,"WOW! I have used about every iOS scanner out there and this one beats them all. Hands down. I do a church web page and a lot of the material I put on the site is from the church newsletter. Print form. And so, it needs to be converted to text to be formatted for the website. Being able to send the outcome directly to Pages, I can then go on my desktop and format the text and get it ready for the Web. The batch scan feature along with the tremendously  great accuracy and speed, enhance my work flow. The $99.99 seem like a lot but you get what you pay for and then some.

Seeing AI,"I use this app on an old iPhone SE 2016, seems extremely unresponsive, and also when I use document, it sometimes doesn’t load the document after taking picture saying, error loading file, or something like that.

I’ve helped someone install a software update, use an automatic tea brewer, choose the right socks to pair with an outfit, and several other simple tasks. Connecting thru the phone and using the other person’s camera to see is just ingenious. The interaction is straightforward and focused, allowing the blind person an easy way to get assistance with dignity. The pay-off for me is an opportunity to put just a little more goodwill into the world, in gratitude for all the times I’ve been the recipient of aid and kindness.",02/18/19 0:59,5

This would be five stars but the quality of the video calls make it hard to give help. The last call I had left both of us frustrated, the person I needed to help was walking around a street looking for a street address but the numbers were so grainy we just had to disconnect.

On the one hand it's great and it means there's lots of volunteers, but on the other hand it kinda feels like a waste to keep this app installed hence why I'm deleting it. I hope the app remains helpful to all users, and that they maybe add a way to see your position in q or something I don't really know but just something.",01/25/21 14:28,3

Those other window screen readers really need to have a virtual camera feature which is also scriptable and customizable.

Be My Eyes,As a sighted volunteer I really like the “Be My Eyes” app. I feel like I’m making a positive impact by helping the visually impaired. I hope the app continues to make updates because sometimes the other persons video is not as clear and makes it harder to provide assistance. I also think for feedback there should be 2 questions - first about the call quality with the person & 2nd about the technological quality. Overall very awesome experience,08/09/20 14:17,4

The app connects visually impaired users with people who can help with using internet, reading signs, identifying objects, etc. Someone from India called.

Be My Eyes,Really easy to get set up and I really enjoy helping!,11/08/22 3:27,5
TapTapSee,"This app is great when it comes to acurate discription of objects and seens and such. It's really cool to point it out the window when I'm in a car or something and it tells me pretty accurately what's out there. Like ""Brown field with green trees"" or ""Black car parked in front of store"". It also is really good with discribing objects. I was in a dentist office and they had decorations all around of wrapped presents. I tryed to get seeing AI to tell me about the boxes but it kept focusing on other things like the chair or the table. But tap tap see said ""Red and white striped box"" which is exactly the information I wanted. I usually use Seeing AI for money and stuff because it's quick, but I use this one for objects because Seeing AI not very good. But, one time, I opened the app and it said something like ""Tap the right side of the screen for pictures and left side for video"". I was interested, and tryed it. But it just took another picture. I tryed it in landscape, but same thing. I even looked it up on the website and it said it could do 10 seconds of video, so I tryed again. Still, just a picture. I tryed doing a video with the Galory and I tryed that. Only pictures showed up. The video thing really got my hopes up but it doesn't work. Maybe something happened because it's not in the app discription. If it wasn't for this, it would be a 5 stars most definitly. But because of this it gets the rating it did. I really think if your going to make something for a visually impaired person, make some better directions or if it's not doing it anymore take those direction of the website. Again, I'm really sorry for this, but I think you shouldn't do that.",12/30/19 12:54,3

OneStep Reader,"I am sighted, and was testing this app for recommendation to my 
non-technical blind friend for daily use. Books and newspapers can be 
accessed and read online these days, and she's looking for a tool to help 
with daily tasks such as counting calories, reading signs, and reading 
product instructions and recipe cards. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend 
this app. I tested it on nutrional facts, and they were spoken without any 
pauses at all, making a list of useful data into a confusing stream of 
alternating numbers and words - it skipped one chart almost entirely! I'm 
not sure if the app even read the calorie information, come to think of it. 
I also tested it using a clear picture of the flat back of a cleaning 
spray, and the cautions and instructions were unintelligible, with quite a 
few strings of rarely-used characters such as carets and mathematical 
symbols inserted into the text. I compared the same image of the back of 
the chemical spray using Google translate OCR, and it handled adequately, 
conveying the meaning of the instructions clearly enough to be useful - so 
the legibility of the recognized text is definitely not due to the quality 
of the image. I suspect aerosols would fare more poorly! I do like the 
option to tell you the orientation of the page, but even that could be 
improved by perhaps using a series of bells (low for counterclockwise, high 
for clockwise, and tinkling when centered, for instance) to direct 
orientation instead of relying on a guess-and-check system.",06/20/18 7:55,2

OneStep Reader,Hi the app is amazing but it keeps saying I have 43 recognition left even though I've already paid for the app. please advise what to do,03/13/19 14:03,2
Seeing AI,"I installed this app the day I first heard of it, while listening to the ACB national convention nearly two years ago.  Even though I had had KNFB Reader for a number of years, I mainly added this one for comparison, but soon discovered that it compares favorably with the aforementioned app, as well as with other light-detecting, color-identifying and currency-reading apps I have used over the last five years. I soon realized that I needed to get a newer iPhone in order to use the Products feature—which I did.  I use the app just about every day, for everything from reading mail to reading books, some magazines, and cooking instructions on that packaged dinner I just pulled out of the freezer, and even making sure that coupon I plan to use at a local business hasn’t expired.  The Short Text works especially well, for those times you don’t wish to scan an entire document.  For most things, the Document channel works well, and I like it that the focusing is done automatically.  However, there are occasions when I get the “No text recognized” alert; so then, I revert to KNFB Reader, and sometimes it does a better job reading that document.  I am totally blind from birth; so I am assuming that the documents for which I get that alert are those printed in multiple colors, and with numerous graphics that land smack in the middle of the written text.  I can’t vouch for the color identifier channel—as I have never been able to see color; but, knowing that lighting can affect the way color is perceived—even by a good set of eyes—my take is that any attempt at a color identifier is better than none at all.  The currency reader has improved markedly since the app first came out.  I have been able to read a number of handwritten greeting cards—and other items as well—with the Handwriting channel.  The light detector has saved me any amount of grief, since I have a number of light switches (for overhead lights, of course), which are push-buttons rather than up-and-down toggles; and, we all know people who can’t remember to turn the lights off when they leave.  I’ve had considerable fun with the Scene channel, which is often quite accurate.  I have occasionally had a bit of difficulty getting the bar-code reader (Product channel) to work; but then, bar codes aren’t always in the same location on a box or container.  Just today, I had to search diligently for the bar code on a frozen meal, in order to then read the cooking instructions.  By the time I found and read that information, my battery status had dropped precipitously, from 85 to 60 percent!  If one is using the app for any length of time at a stretch, I suggest that they either have their phone plugged in, or have an external battery handy, as it is a major drain.  On the other hand, this afternoon I was able to read an online menu—which was otherwise totally inaccessible because it was an _image— from a local restaurant.  In this case, SeeingAI did a better job reading it than KNFB Reader!  Finally, to those who insist that there is no currency reader channel, could it be that they are still on an iPhone 5S or earlier?  And to those who insist that the app doesn’t work well with VoiceOver, perhaps they are just new to VoiceOver and need help with it?  This has really been a life-changing app!  I look forward to even more improvements and enhancements, and apologize for the length of this review.",05/26/19 23:28,5
Be My Eyes,"I think this is a brilliant app!!! Everyone has a little time in their life

And also currency and document and barcode reader and I think more features should be added to it just like iPhone has indoor navigation and many more features should be added to it So, I hope this app will get this feature through update soon Thank you so much and team is working on it and update will be push soon as possible.

of a greater network as a volunteer. Edit: I, had this for a year, and I 
didn't have a single call, except possibly once when I got a very fast 
notification that said someone DID call but my phone never rang. 🤦🏽‍♀️ I 
eventually uninstalled it. There are people that say they've had two or 
three calls in their first few months. Whatever. Uninstalled this a while 
ago.",08/08/18 20:50,5

The call took a bit longer than it needed because we chatted for a few minutes. 
It was so nice to be able to help someone. 
She was so very pleasant and it brightened up my afternoon too. 
This app is the best thing since sliced bread!

Seeing AI,After last update the app crashes immediately in my iPhone X,10/12/20 14:46,5
OneStep Reader,"I was very excited to try this new app, but am very disappointed. There are a number of problems for a person with low vision:

1)	the icons are not intuitive, and there is no simple legend in the complete manual to show what function each icon performs.
2)	the printed version on the phone is almost, but not quite, large enough for me to read. My vision is approximately 20/100 and the large font on my iPhone allows me to read e-mails and texts easily. Ironically, this app doesn’t even allow for the same large fonts available in these basic iPhone functions.
3)	The first images I took resulted in a text translation that was imply jibberish. I took a picture of a book page, but the text on the screen, and the read aloud translation made no sense. 

An app like this is sorely needed for people who simply have low vision, but aren’t completely blind. I sincerely hope that there will be improvements for those of us who can almost function, but not quite, without adaptive technology.",10/01/14 12:12,1

Seeing AI,"Ever since day one when I downloaded this app, I've known I'd write a review, but kept forgetting. so today when I needed to identify my debit card and used Seeing AI to do just that, I stopped everything to write this review. thank you, Microsoft! 

the short text option has been wonderful for quickly sorting unopened mail, and the document reader has been fabulous for reading mail. I've used the app to quickly identify food items and the best part? A cookbook I have that my mom made for me before she died that that other OCR app couldn't read. I can now read my mom's old recipes. Thank you, thank you Microsoft!",08/10/17 18:40,5

One more thing I have a suggestion if possible can you put a tone or vibrate notification in the app to let us know that the app is still open so we won’t forget to close it because the camera will still be on sometimes and I forget.

Be My Eyes,Phenomenal app doing good in the world.,03/24/23 14:57,5

Be My Eyes,"I love this app! It’s a quick, easy way to put some good out into the world and help someone. The interface is easy to use, and I haven’t had any trouble with it. I don’t get a lot of calls (I’ve only gotten 3 or for in the last 6 months), but it’s always a good experience!",06/08/20 20:08,5
Be My Eyes,I love helping people.   Be My Eyes APP is excellent for both the blind and the volunteers.  It’s excellent for the both because it’s gives him or her the opportunity to communicate with someone.,11/28/20 16:54,5
Envision AI,"this app is amazing. It does everything in a great way. it is easy to use, well-organized, feature rich, and offer great value for money. I rely on it daily to scan documents and read them accessibly, recognize objects, and read screens.",11/08/21 0:41,5

Be My Eyes,I got my first call yesterday and it was a simple and easy experience to answer the question of the caller and help them with that small task in their day. I enjoyed our brief interaction and it felt great to be of help in even a small way. I wish there were more services like this available in the world.,05/24/23 18:10,5

Be My Eyes,With just a few minutes of your time and almost no effort other than answering a call you can make a difference in someone’s day for the better. It always makes my day when I get the opportunity to answer the call and help someone. The calls can just be a few seconds with someone asking what color a piece of clothing is for an outfit. I absolutely love it!,03/03/22 19:11,5
Be My Eyes,Love this app! I've enjoyed helping kind people across the country. Highly recommend joining the movement.,02/07/18 2:44,5
Be My Eyes,Plz my first call,01/01/18 0:51,5
Be My Eyes,"I've only gotten 4 calls since installing the app a year or two ago. There are so many volunteers, that's probably normal, but I still make a point to try and open the app once each day. Regardless of what the developers say, I suspect sometimes my phone's battery-saving settings can get in the way of it running in the background. If you never get any calls ever, try that.",01/30/21 21:03,5
Be My Eyes,great idea but it crashed immediately after I made an account.,01/17/15 0:05,2

Be My Eyes,"Not good,this App realy Irritates me,because taking a picture and then you havr to read whats in the picture but how can a blind person read what it is,why isnt there AI reading for you,when i first saw this on the news couple of years ago it showed, (AI be my eyes whats in the fridge) and it tells you what's in fridge and what you could make to cook and tell you expriary dates and stuff,so I installed the App as im registered blind,I just wish it worked like Describe on the news.

Be My Eyes,"Hi, I haven't had a call for a long time, so have just checked my app to make sure it's all updated, which it is. When I open the app however, there is a red notice at the top saying ""turn off background restrictions to receive calls as intended"".

Be My Eyes,"BeMyEyes is by far my all time favorite app! Every time I get a notification I rush over to see if I can join a phone call. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use and makes the process for the caller and the receiver very seamless. I love the articles that are pushed out too! I do wish the call alerts were set up differently than the regular alerts just so you could distinguish the difference, but all in all love this app and recommend to everyone!",05/18/21 14:51,5
Be My Eyes,I'm a volunteer and received my first call the other day. It was very straight forward and I could even turn on the flashlight on the blind person's phone to see better in a dark room. I also appreciate that I could select multiple languages to help in. Overall a great app and a great idea!,11/05/21 16:23,5

Be My Eyes,I have installed the app few months ago.. But I have not received any calls till now,06/04/19 2:38,2
Be My Eyes,"I very much like this app I just installed it would go and have her see my first phone call today, it was very heartwarming to be able to help the person out, and when I read the other reviews about the app and how it's useless, it kind of pisses me off because people don't realize I don't care enough to read that when a blind person needs help it connects them to ten callers so it's only when they're the first one to pick up they get connected",06/13/19 15:42,5
Be My Eyes,Great idea for an application!,12/29/17 11:58,5
TapTapSee,"For the visually impaired this app is not that helpful. This app has potential but having to turn on the Voice Over option makes it really bothersome because then all of the touch commands are different. So I you can see well enough to navigate your iPhone with Voice Over On, then you don't need this app.  But the identification of items is crazy good. So I would say it depends on what you want the app to do for you.  For me, it's not worth the hassle of trying to use the phone with the Voice Over On.  Can you change it to work with just the sound/volume On?",01/23/14 11:03,2

Seeing Eye GPS,Are you people out of your mind charging such an outrageous price? I think it is very greedy of you. I am very very disappointed and very angry that your taking advantage of blind people in this way. The only reason you're getting one star is because I cannot submit zero stars What a rip off and a disgrace to your taking advantage in this way.,07/02/13 12:36,1
Be My Eyes,I absolutely love this app! My dad is blind & I answer his FaceTimes all of the time to help him figure something that seems so simple out. When I learned of this app I knew that I wanted to use My eyes to help others who may not have a daughter to call! It brings me such joy each time I have the opportunity to help someone in need! 10|10 I highly recommend.,05/05/22 22:03,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing. I'm a volunteer and have helped so many wonderful people. It helps people who actually need it, and also gives people a way to give back.

OneStep Reader,"I’d had this app for more than three years, and have really liked   it overall, even though I am a bit of a klutz.  However, with Version 3.0, it has become much more difficult to use, at least for this user.  For one thing, the new user manual isn’t very helpful; it tells us what the app can do, but doesn’t really tell us _how to do things. With this significant an update, giving us the how-to is extremely important. For instance, importing text from other sources used to be very straightforward—and it worked well.  Now, when I try to import something, I first have to find where the material _went.  At first, in this version, it went into a folder called “Inbox” (not even mentioned in the user manual).  With the latest update, however, “Inbox” is gone, and I have to search for it among the saved files, even though it technically hasn’t been saved yet.  Then, I have to go through all kinds of hoops to save the document in a form that will recognize the text.  Sometimes, the field of view report doesn’t work now.  The whole thing is just harder to use, especially if I am saving documents.  If the user manual were written from the viewpoint of a _new user, it would benefit all of us.  Prior to this, I would have given it a higher rating.
Update, Jan. 10, 2019: It just keeps getting worse. It still does reasonably well for reading and saving otherwise inaccessible material from websites; but, with iOS 12 and later, scanning documents such as books, magazines, and even mail is becoming less successful. Even reinstalling the app didn’t help. More often than not, the reading comes out Like gibberish now; the automatic picture function almost _never works, and the field of view report is frequently unavailable; at times, it says that the page is upside down when it isn’t; and, in fact, just about the only people who _might be able to benefit from scanning documents with it are sighted users who have different reading difficulties, such as dyslexia. Really, there should be one app for sightless users, and a different one for sighted users. That way, more focus could be given to having all features working and updated. I’m only keeping the three stars because of the ability to import text from otherwise inaccessible websites.",01/09/19 22:57,3
TapTapSee,Absolutely love this app. Hope it's still being maintained.,08/15/18 9:04,4
TapTapSee,"this used to be one of my favorite and most used apps. as a blind person, this app came in handy for identifying canned ggoods, medications, movies, even sometimes colors of clothing. Now however you have to pay for pictures and I have to say I think this is outrageous. they took a good thing and made it a very bad thing. I won't be recommending this app anymore to my friends. and sadly, I won't be using it anymore. It's too bad because it's hard to find good identifier apps out there. and this  app was really really good.  the blind have to already pay so much for adaptive equipment as it is. This was awesome while it lasted. tap tap see just went bye bye.",11/18/13 16:27,1

Seeing Eye GPS,"I don't have a problem with developers making some money, but $10 per month or $70 per year for rather basic GPS functionality? Other blind-specific navigation apps are just as good - if not better, and are less expensive.
Otherwise, the app works fine. I like the simplicity and feel  it does its job. There needs to be unique features to justify the subscription cost. 
I would urge others to look elsewhere for cheaper alternatives that do an equal job for far less.",03/24/16 8:58,2

WeWALK - Smart Map,I am visually impaired and was working with an instructor from The Seeing Eye and we were looking for GPS apps that might work for me. We tried this app mainly because it had a 14-day trial for me to try before it would bill me. We installed the app and went for a walk to try it. The app did not perform well at all and we had decided to cancel and uninstall. Before I could do that I was charged the full amount. This was within a couple of hours of installing the app. Deceptive and dirty business,11/11/22 11:05,1

Be My Eyes,"The addition of AI motivated me to try this app, and it has proven to be life changing! The AI feature is not perfect, but it has enabled me to access visual information like never before. I've used volunteer assistance for things that AI could not help with; great support… Got the answers I needed.",01/27/24 18:29,5

Be My Eyes,"After a call app asks for feedback but only accepts positive feedback, also on the app itself the ""send feedback"" link is broken. So, here's feedback sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. Happy the app exists, I'm a volunteer. Manually updated to the latest version just now because there were issues on the last call. Fix this issue and I'll update review and rating. 💪💞",07/06/23 11:46,2

Be My Eyes,Incredible Service,01/31/20 23:07,5
Be My Eyes,I have received 4 calls to assist. Every time I answer someone else has answered the call. It’s very frustrating when I want to help and I try to answer as fast as I can. It says connecting. But has never connected. I’m tempted to delete the app.,03/24/21 16:13,1
Be My Eyes,"Got my first call on Christmas Day, helping a man identify some food in his fridge! He was so polite & very thankful. What a amazing app! So glad to be of help :)",03/23/23 17:16,5
Be My Eyes,"So far I’ve gotten 4 calls in the last 2 years. The calls aren’t very often because there are so many more volunteers than people to seek the help, but when every call was worth the wait. It feels so nice to help give back.",06/18/21 9:17,5
Be My Eyes,"Amazing idea but the app has some bugs and technical issues. The camera quality is not good enough to help with tasks such as assistance in reading. I also recommend that a sighted person help set up the initial placement of the camera and place some sort of indicator that the callers use to know where to place a document (for assistance in reading mail, for example) so that it can be of a legible distance and position from the camera.",06/11/21 13:40,4

TapTapSee,This app works as a good identification of objects for blind people. It also is extremely helpful in that we can take recognizable pictures to show our cited friends without having to think up a verbal description which may or may not be accurate. Good show.,11/15/13 5:52,5
Be My Eyes,Love this app. A lady needed help while shoe shopping and we had a blast.,07/29/23 7:33,5

Be My Eyes,Very rewarding experience in helping other,11/22/20 7:38,5
Be My Eyes,"Today I went through a life-changing experience. Might feel small for some, but I can’t get over the feeling of helping a blind person do such a small thing as sorting his laundry. The app is not intrusive at all. If anything, I’d love if people would call more often.",07/03/18 13:26,5
Seeing AI,This is one of my favorite applications. But a few weeks ago I had an iPhone 13 and the option to recognize the images doesn't work for me. I hope this problem can be solved soon since it is an option that I use all the time,01/07/22 14:43,3

TapTapSee,Thwesome app! Works great! I love it!,04/21/16 6:32,5
Be My Eyes,I signed up one this app as a volunteer a while ago and waited what seems like forever to get a call. Eventually I forgot about it until I received a call requesting help on a day where I was not having the best of luck. After helping and even having a short chat about where we from due to our accents we bid farewell. Honestly I smiled like a dork for the rest of the day and the call alone helped me realize that even the smallest acts of kindness can really make you feel good. I hope you download this and no matter how long it takes to finally get a call that you take it and brighten the caller and your own day.,10/28/19 17:14,5
OneStep Reader,"This is an excellent program. As a new KNFB Reader user, I read all the directions first. I find that it works exactly as it is supposed to. I have read the negative reviews, and I wonder if previous users are trying to do things the old way, without having read the instructions. I love this program! Not to mention the convenience of having it on my iPhone.",09/15/19 9:32,5

Be My Eyes,Lovely.,11/09/20 18:58,5
Be My Eyes,"Every time I get a call, it does my heart good! So far every call I have received, the person in need is ALWAYS so sweet. 

The only downside I have found to signing up to assist the blind is that I don’t called to help someone enough. There are so many people volunteering to help the blind, that it takes a while to rotate back around to receive another call. 

This app is the favorite out of all my apps!  I actually get to help someone right then and there. It warms my heart knowing a simple answer to a question makes all the difference in the world to someone on the other end of the phone!

Be My Eyes,Such a rewarding experience,02/14/24 14:52,5
Be My Eyes,"While the app is a great idea and I'm sure it has helped a number of people, it's practically useless to the sighted person who wants to help. I've had the app for more than four months and only once has the app alerted me that someone needed help. I answered immediately, but someone else had taken the call first. With 333,000 sighted people and only 25,000 blind using the app, the chances of actually getting to help someone are very slim. Instead, it simply takes up space on my phone.",01/22/16 19:41,2
OneStep Reader,"I don’t think that the recognition is getting any better in the last few releases. Also this application never completely leaves my system. Often times after leaving the application the level vibrator still continues to vibrate the phone. Even if I go into the app switcher and close it that way, I’ve got to restart my phone to get it to stop vibrating. Also in the most recent releases, it doesn’t go back to picture mode if there is no text. I personally find the new tab arrangement more difficult to work with than the original one. My old Nokia and 82 with one of the original versions, seems to still work better. I am using an iPhone 7.",12/23/18 10:25,2

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Hello. I am a blind man from Kabul, Afghanistan. First of all, thank you for making this useful program. In addition, I ask you to add Persian or Dari language if possible. In our country, the number of people who speak Dari is almost 50% of the population of our country. But we have always been victims of sanctions against Iran. Because of Iran sanctions, Persian or Dari languages ​​are not included in services. But we Afghans have always been forgotten. We hope you are fair in this regard.",08/26/21 22:08,5

Seeing AI,I’ve got this app today and it is really amazing. It’s very helpful to people with visual impairment.

TapTapSee,"This app is so amazing. It describes things your phone sees and includes colours and other information. One thing I wish though is that I could copy the text from barcodes and search for that or open the URL if it is a QR code. Right now the app can read them, but it can be hard to memorise the URL and type it in correctly and some of that is case-sensitive.",10/24/16 9:24,4
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,I like this app I used it on my OM trip and it’s very accessible. I like it. It tells me when to walk and when not to walk. I like the sounds too satisfying.,03/29/24 23:55,5
Be My Eyes,I encourage everyone to get this app.  For the visual impaired this is so great to get help with daily tasks.  I can see and have helped many folks from finding the right can vegetable to helping match outfits.  Today I helped someone read a scale.  Easy communication and it really does help the ones that need it.,10/15/22 14:09,5
Be My Eyes,"I just downloaded this app and I'm so so exited to start helping out. I am bilingual and happy to help in both English and Spanish languages, however, the app only allows me to choose one language. If there's a way to select more than 1 language would be great.",08/08/20 9:37,4
Be My Eyes,Brilliant idea,08/09/19 5:58,5
Be My Eyes,"Absolutely in love with this app, but I wonder how many people are getting the help they need or maybe everyone is good? 

I have received one call since I downloaded the app. It also makes me wish I spoke more languages, as I feel much less useful because of my lack of ability to communicate in multiple languages. I am curious if there is app is truly useful, or if this is just not quite what the visually impaired community truly needs? 

More conversation with visually impaired would be good. I would love to have a “chat” feature where the visually impaired community can just call out for “friends” to chat? Maybe improve connections and connect? Like a “seeing” Facebook?",02/06/20 16:43,4

Be My Eyes,"A wonderful app!! Truly lovely ❤️ but I must say, there really should be an a option to be able to input your availability, so that it can be programmed to call you during hours you are actually available. I work full time so it would be nice to be able to say the hours that I'm at home. Plus the app can the hone in the calls on the people most likely to respond :)",08/23/18 9:05,5

I think Be My Eyes has gotten even better with the addition of be my AI. It is awesome. It is truly awesome to take a picture of something and get a detailed description of it. I don’t even get that from family members who described pictures to me. Don’t change it. I love it.",03/02/24 3:57,5
Seeing AI,I am so pleased to see that you made this up and it's great that it's been so important and so helpful I love the Prague channel and when they move the camera to the barcode it reads it out loud so I would like to say thanks for making this up I would really appreciate it if you could still update the app I love it so so much we changed the product channel for the first time on my iPhone and it works so darn well and because of all this I am totally reading it five stars thank you so so much,11/28/21 14:37,5

Be My Eyes,"One of the best apps out there! Yes, the calls are rare due to the fact that the volunteers outnumber the people who need help. Be patient, you'll get your call eventually.

It feels great to know that I’m helping someone improve the quality of their life just by answering the phone! 

I really hope more visually impaired people discover this app and that the use of it makes life easier and safer for them. 

This is the best app ever created. Every app that I’ve ever used is completely for my own benefit. I think it’s absolutely genius how the creators of this app found a way to get people to volunteer in a way that is so easy and convenient.

Be My Eyes,"The call came in and it was an senior woman that wanted to label some cans of veggies, soup, and fruit.  We had a nice session that lasted about 15 minutes.  She was thankful to have a way to identify her cans and I was great full for the opportunity to help make someone's day easier.  A true win-win.

Thank you Be My Eyes for facilitating this opportunity to employ cooperation to improve the world.",07/20/16 15:31,5
Be My Eyes,I love the idea of this app and the fact that it helps but it takes so long to load I have t been able to answer a call. I’ve had three so far and everyone one took so Long to load.,07/27/19 21:39,3
Be My Eyes,"It’s the little things that mean so much to those who are less fortunate. It’s so easy and it’s beneficial for both sides! Such a satisfying feeling knowing you can help someone through the phone! I highly recommend, it doesn’t take up any time, I downloaded it, leave it active, even if you’re just chillin at the park or something, & if they call they call, if they don’t, they don’t! But what’s wrong with a little help and being the helper! :) love this app, such a beautiful purpose.

Digit-Eyes,"Have used version 1 and 1.0.1 and was waiting for an update before writing a review. I have attempted to use the bar code scanning aspect many, many times and all times, it never works! This is a rip off and certainly not worth  $30! This should not be considered a bar code scanner. There are apps that are free or very low cost, which do a way better job than this worthless app.",09/20/10 17:50,1
Be My Eyes,"I love that someone came up with such a much needed app for those who have trouble seeing/completely blind. I had a resident at my facility that slowly lost his sight; and we were shocked to find out there wasn’t many programs/assistive devices accessible through Medicare or our area. I just happened to be researching through ideas when I came across this app. Decided not only would I donate a phone to him, so management could get him on the app. (My heart, and just me in general being empathetic, couldn’t bare to see him so lost in his environment). I also decided to volunteer, and I just had my first phone call. I literally got excited that the app was ringing, but also it was an overall great interaction. 💛💛 This app is a 10/10, hands down.",10/27/22 22:45,5
Be My Eyes,"Uhm, hi good day! I suggest to improve this application by letting the blind to choose him/her assistance. Coz some girls and boys is not comfortable talking with a guy or a girl, especially when the blind is talking about girl things or boy things so that the blind can be comfortable with the volunteers. Thank you",07/18/20 22:50,3

Be My Eyes,"I can no longer receive calls because of some bug in the system.  I get a message that I have not given access to my microphone or camera.  I did enable it in the beginning, but when they did an update, it must have disabled it and it is no longer possible to reenable it.  I wrote BME about it and they said they were aware of he problem, but as far as I can tell, it has not been fixed",12/22/17 23:18,1
Be My Eyes,"God bless the initiators of this platform where people can volunteer to make the world better for others. Its a good thing we should appreciate Allah and care about others.

May Allah reward whoever is behind this initiative abundantly. Amin.",04/01/20 2:26,5

Be My Eyes,"This is such a wonderful app, I learned about it today and signed up immediately. Within 3 minutes I received a call from someone who needed to know what medication they were holding. We take our vision for granted sometimes, and forget how difficult simple tasks can be for the blind. It only takes a few minutes out of your day to help someone read a label or instructions and think of how positively that impacted them. This app is making the world a better place and I’m here for it. ♥️",10/21/22 3:16,5
TapTapSee,This works too well to be just a computer doing it,08/30/13 14:13,5

Seeing AI,Not sure how a blind person is supposed to operate this app which requires you to see in order to operate using the onscreen buttons.,07/13/17 1:25,1
Be My Eyes,I'm a volunteer. And this would be a great opportunity for me to learn how to help other who need help via application.,03/27/24 20:08,5
Be My Eyes,"Easy to set up, clear communication",02/23/22 14:44,5
Be My Eyes,"I just downloaded today and haven't received a call yet but this app has 
lifted my spirits tremendously. I suffer from Chronic Lyme Disease and am 
no longer able to work, volunteer, or even leave the house much. This is a 
wonderful opportunity for me to feel useful again. I have become aware of 
so many horrible things about our world and been so let down by so many 
things I had such faith in before. My search for answers to my health 
problems has opened my eyes to how truly disgusting human beings can be. 
Discovering this app has restored a bit of hope in me today. I really 
needed it. So, THANK YOU!! From the bottom of my heart to all who had a 
hand in creating this, thank you! You are not only helping the blind to 
see, you are helping all of us to see more kindness which is very much 
needed in today's world! ❤ **I also wanted to add that you are able to Sign 
In & Sign Out of the app as a way to show when you are available or not. I 
am not sure if this is new but I noticed that others had suggested that 
they wished there was a way to put hours of availability in so they 
wouldn't miss any calls. If anyone is hesitating because of this, it seems 
they have already come up with a solution. 😉 BRAVO! MAKERS OF BE MY EYES! 
BRAVO!",06/09/18 19:43,5
Be My Eyes,I generally do not review apps but this is a concept that I can get behind. The app has improved substantially in past few months.,12/10/17 17:08,5

Be My Eyes,Got my first call today and it was somebody on the other side of the world playing a prank. That's not funny and not why I signed up. Maybe some vetting needs to take place.,01/02/23 8:11,1
Be My Eyes,In Iran this application is not working without a VPN and VPN mostly decreases the connection quality. So please unblock it and then we could be able to use this app like others without interruptions. In be my AI section please also let us to choose photos from our phone or gallery. Sometimes we seek help but we're not in a hurry and we look for some specialized people who have clues about the thing we want help of. Like a Korg keyboard for example. Let us make the request and get calls later.,04/05/24 19:57,5
Be My Eyes,Great app but have had app for a while and still waiting to get a call ..,06/28/18 12:30,5
Be My Eyes,"I have always enjoyed helping others. This app is so special and I love it. Supper easy to set up and answer calls with a simple tap of the notification. I’ve helped so many since I have had the app. It brings a sense of independence, joy, and peace to every individual in need of a pair of eyes. Something that so many of us take for granted. These days social distancing has forced people to be alone and this app is a great way to help those in need. I wish I could give it 10 stars!! I love it, absolutely great!",02/19/22 17:39,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,It’s like having an accessible traffic light at nearly every corner now. The app is highly accurate and has increased my confidence crossing busy streets.,04/10/23 3:27,5
Be My Eyes,"First call was so disorganized and I remember I didn’t help them as they wished, I was nervous, I failed and it’s a fuzz memory. 
Second call was a angry man with a strong accent. I could tell he didn’t like he was speaking to a soft spoken female American, I’ve been a taxi driver and lived in many states here in the US, I don’t live in a glass houses, he needed a man to speak to. He continually spoke down to me and I finally stopped being peppy and super polite. At one point a male came into his room, they had a awkward negative exchange (why didn’t he ask the sighted person for help) and he angrily told the man to leave his room. He ended hanging up on me while I was speaking telling him basically I can’t help you. He needs a hug 
The third call was a heavy accented young guy whom I’m pretty sure was in his 20’s, oh to be 20 again. He was asking about his stacks upon stacks of perfectly folded boxer briefs, thinking this guy really needs help or is he being naughty with the app? He at one point gave out a nervous laugh, he kept asking me the same questions and finally got the undies he needed. He was polite, thanked me and was friendly through the entire call.
So I feel useless with the app since it’s all been odd experiences. I’ve read comments where people have become friends, chatted for 10 minutes afterward and great heart warming stories that make ya just tear up. 
Hmmmm, I hope my next call I make the persons day and they are on cloud 9, not angrily hanging up on me and putting a damper on my day.",05/14/19 13:32,2
Lookout - Assisted vision,"This is one of the most amazing apps I have ever used! I'm not even sure how I can easily describe all of its features, so I'll just give a quick overview. I find it fun to use. I am sure that those who have limited vision or even no vision at all could find this app incredibly easy to use and very very helpful. It has many modes. It can read labels on cans and other products and tell you what they are. He can tell you the ingredients. It can read the text in books, type written and handwritten",08/25/22 23:29,5

Envision AI,"it is good, but sometimes it does not scan full text",11/01/24 1:48,3
Be My Eyes,The app is difficult as a blind person on an iPhone with voiceover switched on. It's possible to get lost in the app as there are seemingly unavoidable menus at the bottom. It's very hard to get back to the home screen of the app. Apart from that it's awesome 😎,03/08/25 15:58,2

Be My Eyes,"You guys are doing a great job. I love how much more accessible you’re making my life. It reads my mail so nicely. I actually got documents from a court and I read the entire thing to me. I didn’t have to ask anybody to read it to me so I was able to have my own business kept private. Love it keep it going, but it is getting a little hard to get a life person and sometimes you do need a lie person. Please keep them. anyway, love it keep going. Anytime you need a test person. I would love to be one. Thank you.",04/21/24 22:46,5

There's no way to get in contact with anyone, I tried to click the thumb down option after the call, that did nothing, tried the ""send us feedback"" feature, just sent me to my own WhatsApp. The app needs tons of work, it's not that efficient. I'm hoping to get someone's attention from that review so that I can report this guy. I'm not even sure they can trace the call back, I think that'd be way too advanced",06/24/22 18:50,1

I’m registered as blind I rely on things like this then when your unable to use due to its instability and not working I wasn’t potentially impressed.

Be My Eyes,1 phone call in 9 months. It's like my number isn't even in the rotation. Downgraded my 5 stars to 4 stars. I guess I'll have to come back next year to give it a 3. The app is a waste of space if I'm not helping anyone with it.,12/11/22 8:19,4

Be My Eyes,"I thought it would be a fantastic way to lend my eyes. It says it takes awhile to get your first call which is understandable. But now I see why it takes so long. The home screen just spins and spins, never loads. Haven’t seen it load since I first got the app. After that, never loaded again. The “news” section is just fine. Guess lll delete and maybe try again some other time but right now, it’s just taking up space.",01/24/20 5:14,1

Both times, the quality of the videos were so terrible that I couldn't read the information they needed. I'm not sure if it's the app, my end, or theirs.

VoiceVista,"This is definitely a must have for anyone who is blind/visually impaired or who wants auditory information about their surroundings as they navigate. This is very very similar to the shut down Sound Scapes Microsoft app. Microsoft made the code open source, so this app is based off of that.

I missed total 3 calls since I got the app in December, I couldn’t get to my phone fast enough. Felt a bit disappointed but there are others online waiting to help so if you missed a call, it automatically goes to the next volunteer. Awesome app to do volunteer anywhere on your own phone.❤️❤️❤️",05/29/19 22:39,5

You know for what you pay for this thing you'd think it would be mostly decent. I mean there are apps that have like a fraction of the cost but they work way better! I think at one time or a number of times several years ago this app would be on sale for like $20. I think by now they should not sell this app for $100. It's not worth it.

I’m not sure if there are safeguards against any misuse-maybe someone else can comment on that, but I truly love it. If you are multilingual, you can add other languages you speak to broaden your “assist circle!”
I got my first call yesterday and helped someone describe the color of two different garments.  The call used their camera and voice only on my end. It only took about 30-40secs for the call.

TapTapSee,"I think this is a pretty good app for a blind user to have to use for a lot of identification. I've used this app when it first came out or at least since I first heard about it back in 2012 on my iPhone 4s, I was much impressed at to what I heard and now I feel the app has much improved. In fact, the other day, I laid some hand towels out on my bathroom vanity and had the lights on, I needed to know the colors to sort them, since I already knew the colors of towels I had, but not knowing which one was which, I took several pictures with tap tap see and each item was correctly described  of it's color, I managed to even get a pic of myself  of my shirt I was wearing at the time, tap tap see woman wearing a white shirt,that was right too. I've used it in recognizing some items in my pantry as well. It's a good useful app for me, I am very glad it's still available, I had purchased the 100 picture pack, of course I am very glad to have the pictures free, but it would be worth it to me to pay again if that was necessary.",05/19/17 20:20,5

Be My Eyes,"So far I’ve answered 4 calls. There was only 1 I couldn’t help (hooking up an Apple TV, because I couldn’t get the camera to be where I needed it). I want people to know that they shouldn’t even hesitate to use this app. We are here!",01/18/18 6:11,5

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted user that has the joy of assisting those with limited or no sight, I can’t say enough what a joy it is. 
It makes me smile to know I’m helping someone else’s day go a little bit smoother and it really has made my days go smoother as well; a fresh outlook or appreciation for your own world can really have a positive ripple effect.",06/11/21 20:06,5
Be My Eyes,"I have had some really fantastic experiences with this app. The last two are good examples of how this app really works. I was staying at a hotel. At the breakfast room I called for my eyes because I needed to know with the various food items, napkins, plates, cups, and everything else work. the volunteer who answered was excellent. He showed me where the coffee machine and cups were, showed me how to use the machine, and then told me about all the other items that were around. He showed me where the cereal was the milk, the eggs the sausage, the muffins, the bread, the napkins, the plates and silverware were. He was extremely helpful. Because of him, I know where everything was for the week I spent in that place. The second time I called a volunteer while there, I asked her if she could show me how to use the treadmill. She gave me excellent instructions. I did not need cited help from anyone in the hotel. Thanks to these two wonderful volunteers! be my eyes is an excellent app, and it has made my life so much easier. I am so happy that I have it.",03/30/23 1:01,5

Since l don't get any calls for weeks l don't see any need to carry it all the time.Today someone called for help per my mom it ranged over 30 minutes.

Be My Eyes,"I’ve been signed up as a volunteer for a long time and today I finally got my first call. I answered it and was excited to actually help someone. But they could not hear me. I could hear them just fine but they just kept saying “hello? Are you there. Can you hear me?” Clearly they couldn’t hear me so they hung up. Also there was no video at all, which I thought was odd. I’m really disappointed because who knows when I’ll get another chance at this and what if these problems persist. It seems like there are technical problems and they need to be sorted out.",08/18/22 19:43,1

Be My Eyes,"I’m a sighted person and I love this app. I don’t get many calls and when I do sometimes other people get to the call before me but that’s great because that means there are other people out there who are ready and willing to help at a seconds notice. I love being able to help people do their everyday tasks, from trying to pick out the right color tie to making sure they are using the right cleaner for their oven. This app is truly something special, and I think everyone should download it.",10/07/22 0:48,5

Be My Eyes,"App doesn't open. Every time I am alerted ""someone needs your help"" when I go to open it, it says someone else has already answered and thanks anyway. I was told by the app's support to make sure I updated. I updated and same thing. I then thought perhaps I wasn't answering fast enough. I now have been alerted at least 10 times, never being able to answer. Some of those times, I opened the app after only 1 ring. The longest time it rang before I opened out of those 10 occurrences was 4 rings. What a tease. I submitted a support ticket multiple times. It doesn't work. I finally just got rid of it.",08/06/17 16:14,1

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The app gives excellent, audible feedback, so that blind people can know what the traffic signal is doing even when there is no traffic. I have used it with a variety of intersections, and I have found it to be accurate. The only mistake it has made is to not give any feedback, even when it should have. However, after reporting this to the developers, the problem was solved in just a day or two.
Nothing is a substitute for good Kane skills, but this app is definitely an asset to have in one’s travel toolbox.",03/26/23 22:28,5

The video worked well and I was able to help him read what was on his machines screen. You get a good feeling from helping someone with a task the sighted world takes for granted.
Edit: After missing a few phone calls, it might be best if the developers added more time to answer.",01/20/15 23:16,5
OneStep Reader,"This is one of the best reading apps out there.  I've seen it work well for many of my blind/visually impaired friends.  However, it's a bit tricky to use if you have truble with your hands shaking or moving.   I hope that in future updates, this could be worked on.  
I've personally had a hard time getting all four edges of the document to line up with the camra.   Using the field view report thing is also a bit tricky, like someone else pointed out. 
I do like the fact that it allows those with reading disibilities to gain independence as far as being able to read documents and other printed items.
I also hope in future updates, we could be able to use the ALEX voice to read our documents (For those who have ALEX on their devices).  I'm not a huge fan of Samantha, personally.",12/26/14 13:32,4

Be My Eyes,Great app❤️❤️,09/23/19 8:54,5
Be My Eyes,"First off; great job to the developer and their team. I can’t even say anything good (that’s new lol) about this system that hasn’t been said before a million people. I hope this app continues to serve and connect people and even get better at doing that as time goes by.

Which is why I thought I’d mention a couple ideas I thought the developer might find worthwhile implementing:

1. This would take minimal effort, but; I just thought it would be a good setting to add to the app to put volunteer status “on hold” at designated times the user inputs, rather than having to manually log out and log back in every day so you don’t get a notification or call when you’re sleeping, in school, etc., and keeps people from having to remember to sign in every time.
2. General Tasks Descriptions/Specialty Knowledge Requests: I think adding a small list of general description scenarios (perhaps coordinating them to a number, and not speaking any number when making a call would just be usual “miscellaneous” as is) might help to give volunteers a better idea of wether they would be a great/best-avoided choice for the task at hand (under the not-so-common scenarios, it could probably save time for the requesters and volunteers from cycling through a match that can get the objective done; when a particularly special knowledge event requires assistance). This could maybe even go further by giving volunteers skill tables to be able to fill in; and when a special request call requiring knowledge in that field is made, volunteers with knowledge in that field could be alerted first. Example: Something like a “computer science” tag and if a visually disabled person needed a pair of eyes to identify what is keeping them from navigating a voice controlled computer as normal, but a large amount of volunteers might need to also know how to navigate Windows 10 task manager, etcetera. 
Not a perfect example, but my point is just that if the developer and team has the resources and inspiration; perhaps something among those lines are a couple ideas of how they could continue to better the app and keep the world community doing the good stuff it does.
Peace All.",05/20/18 5:58,5

Be My Eyes,"I am blind, and I do ask for help sometimes. Sometimes it's basic things, like reading labels, reading paper, etc at times, I ask for help reading my computer screen or a piece of technology allowed to me, so I can figure out how to diagnose the issue.

I have been noticing that when I called into be my eyes, some people I talk to have been rude towards me. Happens a lot when I ask someone to repeat information to me again to make sure that I heard things right, and when I ask for help navigating my computer screen and they know nothing about technology, as such, they get frustrated with me. One time, it was because I need to flip a switch on an electrical outlet and I could not feel that switch very well, the person I called asked me to call an electrician instead. However, sometimes it does happen that you make friends on the be my eyes app.

There are a few more things that I wish to be added in to this app. It would be cool if volunteers could help you take photos, and the photos they take can automatically be added into your library. Although I am not a volunteer, an I don't know how volunteers use this app, but I think it would be cool if they had the option to zoom in and pan around. I think that would be helpful to volunteers who have trouble reading extremely small text.

Be my eyes is a great place to ask for help when you need it. The thing is, is that you still, sometimes, have to try multiple times when you call. Furthermore, You still need to be careful because at times, you make it someone who is rude. But if you're willing to deal with that, it's still a good app to consider downloading for smaller, non-technical and non-private things.",07/02/20 15:08,4

Be My Eyes,"I just took a Be My Eyes call and spent a hour talking to a 27 year old man from Pakistan who’s going blind. He wasn’t born blind, he’s losing it slowly and he needed someone to talk to as he didn’t get the job he applied for today due to his condition. He’s here on a student visa in NC and was hitting rock bottom tonight, alone with no family around. What are the odds that me, sitting here with a broken arm feeling sorry for myself would get that call? I’ll heal in 6-12 weeks and he’ll never see again. I talked to him about all the wonderful things he has yet to smell, touch, hear, taste and feel, that he has a good life ahead of him. That he’s not alone, I met a new friend named Shehryar. I needed this tonight

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,"This app is okay for those who cannot see.
It seems to be working okay, but there are a few things that makes me be confused.
When I open the app, it sometimes says that I am at the wrong address and then when I’m trying to walk to somewhere with it, when I have searched for the place, it tells me to go in metres, but it never tells me where to turn or if there’s a road or if I should cross the road, it literally just says to go a certain amount of metres and I can’t determine what metres are, so if you could make it tell the roads and maybe to turn left and right and different directions it would make it a lot easier.

Be My Eyes,Just started using be my AI. I had to make a repair on my refrigerator. The important part needed for installation had inadequate instructions. The my AI found a QR code on the package. I scanned the code with my QR reader and got all the information I needed. This new feature is giving me hope for the future. Can't wait to see what comes up next. Maybe dynamic on the fly video. But don't get me wrong. I am appreciative of everything you have accomplished. thank you I will use this app more in the future because I know I will not be using the valuable time of a volunteer with a question that the AI will help me find on my own. But I want to thank all the volunteers out there. It helps me get through my day knowing people care. God bless! I,10/11/23 23:59,5

Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the volunteer to impaired ratio is drastically skewed. There are WAY more visually impaired people who need help this app needs to market to them and advertise more so more visually impaired people sign up. This app sound also alert the impaired that there are 4million volunteers and to please call any second of their day they need help. There are so many of us eager to help I don’t feel like the app does a good enough job in marketing to really impact the visually impaired with out knowledge or whom feel like they are over using the app bc they are not sooo many of us get a call 1-2 time a year they could be calling way more or have way more people signing up to use the app (visually impaired) if they had a more aggressive marketing strategy.,10/23/20 6:40,4

Like show me text of the meaning as I draw them and place them in frame without me having to continuously push a button or guide it to answer . I think it would be handy in alot of different tasks for those learning something new.",07/16/24 23:02,5

TapTapSee,"I used to love this app, but it seems like ever since the app became free to use the quality has dramatically dropped. When I first got this app, I would hold it up in front of the LCD display screens on the thermostats in our home to set the temperature. Our thermostats were pushbutton to adjust the temperature, and had switches to change the mode or turn the fan on and off. If I knew what’s the setting was on, I would know how many times to press the button to set it to the desired temperature. For instance, Tap Tap See would tell me that the thermostat was set at 60°, and that the house temperature was 65. I was then able to realize that if I wanted to set the heat at 68 that I would simply need to push the up button eight times. Recently though, I have resorted to calling AIRA when I need help adjusting the thermostat as this app will say something along the lines of thermostat is set at 20/5. Also, I loved the new video feature that was being introduced, with this app, but this feature was very short-lived. I have anxiously been waiting for it to return for nearly a year now, and nothing has come out. Unless a miracle occurs, I suspect this app is finished with updates and will soon be retired just as the Look Tell money reading app was.",02/13/20 15:32,1
Be My Eyes,"I love answering calls because it humbles me that low vision or blind people go through a lot of extra work just to get through daily life. And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I’m having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can’t want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me.",09/19/18 14:26,5

Be My Eyes,Great that one can help others without going anywhere!,02/24/20 23:08,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing as-is! As a sighted person, I have a few thoughts to really take this app to the next level of helping people with visual impairments (and possibly other disabilities). 

Many people prefer something simplistic like this app. However, I could see a companion app being made with an entire social network. 
-- People could friend each other so they can re-request help from the same people. 
-- When a disabled person gets excellent assistance, the helper could receive a rating of some kind (and high quality ratings could lead to more calls for help). It would also be nice if a blind person could show appreciation by sending free e-gifts or even real gift cards. Most people just aim to be helpful and don't expect anything in return, but when someone does something above and beyond to help me with my physical disability, I feel that it's important to show my gratitude somehow so I won't feel like I'm taking advantage of others time and efforts. You could also make it possible to earn mPoints where helping someone will earn points, and high ratings and being given e-gifts will earn a boatload of mPoints as a reward, which can then be traded for free gift cards or prizes. (I'm certain mPoints would work with you to make this happen!) 
-- Sighted people could turn their availability on or off so they won't be disturbed at a bad time. 
-- Sighted people could use hashtags and write detailed profiles that indicate their special skills (i.e. I'm a higher ed mentor/tutor and teacher who could assist with homework help, I could list my computer and tech proficiencies, I could list the languages I speak, my fashion sense, my experience with children, my age, etc.), and then disabled people could search for people with particular skills (and have the profile read to them to get more information) to get the best possible help. 
-- If immediate help isn't available, there could be a public Twitter-like stream where requests for help can be posted with video and/or photo and written description. Any addressed issues that are helped in this manner would be marked as helped so a disabled person isn't bombarded with answers. Additionally, friends could post requests on each other's wall that will be seen when their friend becomes available again. 

This is just some possibilities that could be made available with a more social network-like app. I still think this simplistic app is best for many people, but others could surely benefit from a second app with the added features of a network. Please work on developing this!

Also, open up community beta testing via TestFlight! I have 19 years experience with testing hardware/software and would love to help ensure that the app remains bug-free and 100% usable by the people who rely on it most!",05/12/16 4:10,5

I truly enjoy getting the honor to answer a call. I’m always a little upset when I can’t answer quickly enough, but I fully realize that another volunteer will grab it. I’ve been an RN for 35 years so I am a helper by nature, but there is something so rewarding about randomly helping out a stranger. I’ve received calls at work that I was able to answer and I’ve had colleagues standing by watching, they go on to get the app as well. 😊😊",09/29/21 20:54,5

Be My Eyes,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE join this free app and support those with sight problems. 

Imagine you lost your sight even partly and could not do your daily tasks as easily anymore. Imagine someone (a random stranger) not only could help, but WANTED to!! 

This is the best app for anyone with sight issues to be easily assisted in fulfilling a self sufficient lifestyle. My only negative is as there are now so many volunteers signed up, I don’t get nearly as many calls as I would like. 

In my opinion everyone that is fully sighted, should be signed up to this to be eligible for free NHS treatment. Be kind. Give back.

How do I know if I'm ever going to receive calls for help? Do I need to leave the app open in the foreground at all times? Do I need to relaunch the app every hour? Every day? Every 15 minutes? What if I turn off my phone and then turn it on again? It's very confusing about what I'm actually supposed to do in order to provide help... there are no instructions! Even worse, the app won't be that useful if we are manually required to keep relaunching it all the time or keep it open.",01/21/15 14:51,3
Be My Eyes,"I hate to complaint but I download this app the day it come out, ever sense I have maybe revive only hand full of calls but ever sense in the last year this app has been wasting space in my phone, if I knew this was going to be the case I would of had volunteer in my church more soon.

Be My Eyes,Recently when trying to answer calls it continuously loads and does not answer. Please fix this.,12/02/21 13:17,2
Be My Eyes,I’ve been a member for 9 months and only received one call but that one call meant everything. It was a good feeling knowing you are helping someone out,09/03/20 22:16,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"Not very helpful. 3 stars for outstanding entertainment value. While pointed at the cat: ""Cat. Cat. Hedgehog. Cat. Hedgehog. Worm. Cat. Cat. Caterpillar. Cat. TWO porcupines!"" (and this is where I entirely lost it and understood the meaning of ""literally dying from laughter"", husband thought I had choked on something, or having a heart attack, or lung collapse?!) Highly entertaining app. Absolutely useless.",02/11/23 5:17,3
Be My Eyes,Love how easy it is to help people,09/10/20 11:02,5

was great to be able to help someone out like that.",06/25/18 18:59,5

Be My Eyes,"I am proud of the human race when an app like this is developed. It’s so simple and easy to respond to someone who may simply want to know if their chicken is fully cooked before they eat/serve it. 
You won’t be inundated with calls either. I’ve been available 2-4-7 for almost a year and have only had one call come through before another volunteer answered first. There are almost a million volunteers for approximately 80,000 app users who are visually impaired or blind.

Be My Eyes,My one and ONLY complaint is that I can’t help more!!! I love this and the community it brings together!! Thanks for the awesome app!!,08/03/18 21:57,5
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for a little over 2 years now and it's wonderful. The concept is fantastic, the interface is fault-proof, and it's very simple to use. It's even better when the person you're talking to is actually interested in having a brief conversation. But sometimes that's not the case, and that's totally okay- we all have busy lives. Easy to stop what you're doing for a few minutes to help. No excuse not to have this app! Everyone should get it and help. Thank you for creating this!",12/07/17 1:41,5

Be My Eyes,There is no need for a person who wants to help to get this app. I have had it for close to 5 months and haven’t gotten one call. I’m very sad and discouraged.,07/17/18 22:13,1
Be My Eyes,"I am blind. This is just creepy. I read the privacy policy. No privacy effectively. Also very weird to share with strangers. Talk about open to abuse. Not for me thanks. OH BTW. Taking 23 months (nearly 2 years) to respond to a Privacy concern pretty much sustains my argument that your privacy assurances are not reflected in either your policy, nor are they reflected by your actions.",01/28/20 14:42,1

Be My Eyes,"Sound doesn't work. I got one call and it hung up immediately.

Be My Eyes,"Missed my first call months ago, and had forgotten all about it. Jump ahead to just a moments ago and I was asked to take a call. 

I was connected with a lovely gentleman who had misplaced an item in his home. Finding it wasn’t too difficult with us working together and we got the item back where it belongs!

This seems like such a useful tool for those who  need it, and to ask those with sight to just simply be willing to take a call and try to help when available? That isn’t such a big ask at all.",10/13/24 4:49,5

RightHear - Blind Assistant,hi this feels promissing but ive just been using it to see if im facing the right direction i dont go out much but the location accuracy feels like its good was just thinking if there can be an option to create your own accessible space in the indore mode for example i can map out the rooms and enterances of my house and like describe different spots based on the location im in it felt preety accurate was showing the acuracyof upto 4 meters that with compass direction could be godsent,03/02/23 1:06,5

Had a gentleman ask me if the lights were flashing on a device he had in front of him, told him yes and then had a nice 5 minute chat with him about his day. With how many apps are out there that charge for this charge for that, this is probably the best and simplest idea that works so well 👌",12/01/23 2:01,5

OneStep Reader,"The KNFB reader it originally was a very easy to use and user-friendly application for the visually impaired. With the most recent release, the functionality of the application has to graded, it is much more difficult to go right back to taking pictures of the next page, it takes 3 to 4 times longer to swipe through all the screens to get back to where you need to be to read the next page and many of the features which are never used seem to be highlighted.

Digit-Eyes,"The first thing I will say concerning the Digit-Eyes app is this; if you are a person easily frustrated and/or unwilling to put  effort into challenges, I strongly recommend you avoid this app.

The above comment is not intended to diss digitize it anyway. It’s just that it will take some time and practice to get fairly successful with digitize. I personally find it to be an extremely helpful option because I live alone and I got, frankly, tired of accidentally adding sauerkraut to my chili when I think I’m adding tomatoes. In short, I find digit-eyes an extremely useful and usable app!",05/11/19 7:24,4

Seeing AI,"I use this app for tons of stuff!
No more KNFB Reader!.  It helps me with clothing selection with colors, I spot-check my mail with short text so I don’t have to sit down with Kurzweill until I know it’s not JUNK!  I can use Document for obvious stuff, and the Product for re organizing my kitchen cabinet & putting away GROCERIES—It isn’t as up to date as an I.D. Mate, but it isn’t $1200 either!!
I even use it to see if I get the TV on when I get lost in the TV vs. Cable-box or Apple TV fight.  I EVEN use it to see if I have any BIOS POST errors, or to see if Windows is UPDATING or such when my PCs take forever to BOOT!  Needs some flourishes to be added, and I have a few suggestions, (already sent in!) but I try and get ev’body to think of and find new ways to use this app.

Be My Eyes,"I’ve only got to help one person so far. Usually when the phone rings it’s picked up quicker than I can get to it! I feel there are more people that want to help than blind people that know it’s an option, or at the least someone on the other end wants to help. I helped an American woman that was at the laundromat at 5am. Me being in the UK meant I was awake and able to help her. We had a lovely chat too. I actually wish there were more sight impaired people using it because there are so many sighted people ready and willing to help. They need to properly advise the site impaired about this service better.",03/26/22 16:41,5

Be My Eyes,I don’t know if there is any feeling quite as good as being able to help someone. It definitely makes my day and week better to be able to help in any way I can. It makes the world seem smaller and more human that we all need help with things at times and there are people around the world willing and able to help. Love this app!!!!,10/28/18 14:43,5

VoiceVista,"This app gives me the equivalent of street signs and maps that I can explore. I've tried other apps but they're much harder for me to understand because they say the name of the street or other location like it's right in front  of me rather than making the sound come from that direction. I can understand the space around me much better with this app. A minor thing is that when I'm running or tandem biking, I like to hear how fast I'm going. Voice Vista tells me this at random whenever it feels like it. How can I ask it for my velocity?",02/26/25 17:56,5

Be My Eyes,"Sounds like a good app. I was hoping to help people who are not able to see. Had the app for 3 months, had 2 calls come in and as soon as I accepted the video disconnected. Maybe too many volunteers but the app is taking space on my phone. Really of no use to me if the video calls disconnect as soon as I try to accept. Deleted the app. Good luck to the rest of you. Maybe you'll have better luck.",08/28/19 10:53,1

Be My Eyes,"I love this app in general. I find the concept of helping people, with them and I having access to this app easily, is honestly genius. However, I use this app for volunteer work in a foundation. The one thing I would appreciate is the option to record the call, or at least document the duration of the call. Apart from the actual call itself, the option to evidence the call would be a very helpful feature.",06/01/20 5:18,4

But prepare yourself, your first call, whether it be about resources(I’ve guided someone through ordering groceries )or the temperature on the stove(I’ve guided someone through setting 2 stoves to the temperature they desired), they are equally important,significant,and unique.the founder of this program is amazing , I am glad I am placed perfectly to help ❤️",08/19/22 15:40,5
Be My Eyes,"What a brilliant idea. This app works very well and leaves me feeling good after every use (I'm a sighted helper), knowing I at least tried to help (it doesn't always work out quite as one might hope, but that's not the app's fault). My kudos and thanks to the developers.

Oh – I hadn't opened the latest version of the app before I wrote that. I'm disappointed to see that the points system and my stats are gone now. Neither can I any longer attach a photo to my profile (though I suppose if the only people who would encounter it are blind, it is really kind of pointless).

So now my jury is a little more out on the app. I'll have to see how it works in actual use now before I can really say more about it.",05/30/17 23:54,4

Be My Eyes,"I haven't used it yet but I will and I think this is fantastic. I read a few reviews about people not recieving calls for months. I'm leaving this review to see how far you guys have gone on advertising this app directly to the ones who actually need it. Hospitals, retirement homes, homes for the blind should be places to target to expand the audience and customer's in need or people who want to help. A lot of people can get it for their love ones. Keep up the good work though.",07/06/19 10:25,5

Be My Eyes,How easy to answer a call and assist someone!,05/08/19 0:02,5
Seeing AI,Love this app. I lost my vision three years ago and was told that this app is very useful. I use it almost daily on the go in at home. Everything works pretty seamless except for the color reader which can be kind of an accurate at times. It would be amazing if you guys can add some thing that would be able to read digital clocks. Unfortunately a lot of my devices in my home have digital clocks like my stove my washing machine my thermostat etc. I do use a lot of smart devices in my home but some of them are not able to be hooked up to my smart devices. So it would be pretty cool if I could hold the phone in front of the stove to see what temperature the oven is on or how much time is left on the washing machine etc. Overall absolutely love this application. Keep up the good work,10/25/21 13:03,4

Be My Eyes,"This is a wonderful example of using the Net to help people! Frustratingly 
it's taken 6 months after installation for me to successfully answer a 
call. The reason is that (unlike the telephone app) the app doesn't 
'supersede' my Android phone's lock screen, so every time a Be My Eyes call 
comes in, by the time I have tapped in my unlock code, someone else has 
answered it! I hope they can fix that.",07/16/18 12:57,4
Be My Eyes,I love whomever created this app! Such a humbling experience.,05/02/23 20:53,5
Be My Eyes,Great app with a simple concept. For a sighted person it's as simple as installing and logging in. Then you just wait for someone to call and answer if it is convenient. For a sighted user it is super easy to use. Unfortunately I'm not too sure how well it works for the non sighted person Easy way to earn some good karma or to have a regular dose of the good feels during the day. I'm happy to lend my sight to those who can benefit from it.,08/22/18 20:30,5

Seeing AI,"I am not blind (and thank goodness), merely have failing sight.  But I cannot imagine being completely sightless and being able to utilize this app for anything.  The periodic pop up warnings and tutorial screens give NO auditory alerts.  So I could picture it being endlessly frustrating for someone who couldn't see the screen.  

That being said, this is an interesting display of advancements in AI visual interpretation.  It does recognize certain things, and even read a pill bottle label to me.",07/15/17 8:38,3

It fills my heart whenever I️ help someone, whether it be with mail, picking out an outfit, or other daily things.  I’ve seen plenty of bad reviews saying they’ve never gotten any calls, but it took me over 3 months to get my very first call.  It takes time because there are over 1 million volunteers and less than 100,000 blind people.  You’re not going to get calls everyday!!",10/16/18 19:12,5
OneStep Reader,Every blind / vision impaired individual with a smartphone or tablet should own this app - it makes organizing paper documents easy by saving the captured text to your device it's an excellent way to go paperless. The only two minor issues that prevent a 5-star rating are 1. It's tricky to capture document field if you have no vision at all and 2. If you happen to own both Android / iOS devices there's no way to download a single app on both devices without purchasing twice...,02/01/17 20:02,4
Be My Eyes,Great experience and opportunity to help the world of visually impaired people. Love helping people with the average day to day tasks and decisions. I hope this is still around when/if my eyes go!,11/01/20 3:41,5
Be My Eyes,This site needs to really do background checks to be sure the so called visually impaired are actually impaired. Every call I’ve received seemed as if it was men acting odd and obviously able to see. I felt violated each time.,06/30/23 6:21,1
Be My Eyes,What a wonderful app! Blessings to whomever created Be My Eyes!,03/04/22 14:39,5

Be My Eyes,I’ve loved helping people via this app. No call has been the same and it’s fun to engage with folks in other parts of the country.,02/19/25 16:28,5
Be My Eyes,"It makes me happy that there are way more volunteers then blind people signed up for this service.  It means humanity still has hope.  After a year of being a volunteer, I answered my first call today.  Something simple.  Identifying a bag of beans.  Someone is cooking beans and sausage for dinner tonight.  

Sometimes I love technology",06/15/20 16:29,5

Be My Eyes,"The concept of Be My Eyes captured me from the very moment I heard of it. It is amazing experience for both the blind and all ranges of the sighted. I missed my first call, but it came in my first two weeks of having the app and I couldn't find how to answer it. I'm still looking forward to that second call. It still hasn't come through... So many others have signed up since then, that there are lots and lots of volunteers to help blind users!",05/20/19 13:56,5

TapTapSee,This app is brilliant and I don't need to rely on family members to tell me which flavour of food packets are in a certain box. I no longer need someone to find a tin of Baked Beans for me. apps such as this gives me much more independence in the kitchen.,02/01/13 13:28,5

Be My Eyes,Great example of humanity ❤️,02/12/20 1:47,5
Be My Eyes,"this great app actually works!!! For those who need sight assistance and those willing to visually assist!!!

It works so well that I started thinking that The Developer should create a Language Companion version for people on vacation or otherwise learning on the spot (not studying) who happen to be in another country, especially in countries whose language doesn't use Latin characters (English, Spanish, etc) that someone could atleast attempt to sound out the word. Imagine someone in an Eastern European country or in North Africa or North Asia? Completely different character base of writing, and no way to guess the word or phrase and forget the online translators, you could insert a phrase in English asking for a zoo and the translator could just as easily translate to asking for a live butcher market. (or worse, some form of insult or even criminal intent). 

Also, rstone is ok for some people who are receptive to learning in the way they use, but as a native speaker of 5 languages, I can say that if created, this type of app would be like having a native speaker of not just the language, but even of the country or local dialect in a country region (or a bunch of people along with someone on vacation or has moved to another country for work or other necessity).
Developer, Feel free to contact me, I'd love to help in this regard. 
Again, Great App !!! Cheers!!!",05/08/16 17:23,5

Be My Eyes,"As a volunteer, getting a call from this app literally makes my day. It's such a simple way to help other people just by answering a call. Over the years, I've helped people to figure out how to match the correct color shoes into the corresponding boxes for a return, checked someone's thermostat was set to the correct temperature, read labels on boxes at the grocery store, and helped someone choose their favorite flavor of Rice-a-Roni from their own pantry. Couldn't recommend more!",04/03/24 8:41,5
Be My Eyes,Superb. Thanks for invented this app.,08/27/21 19:44,5
Be My Eyes,if you want to earn a bit extra money the app is fairly easy to use and straightforward but will mark you down for the slightest issue and ask you redo the take again so don't wast you time,03/23/24 2:04,1

TapTapSee,"me and my husband enjoy using this wonderful for the blind.  wish it had more funtion to read the small print as well as the large print, this will make this app unbelivable to use as a very powerful app.  keep up the improvement on this app.",06/02/15 13:47,5
Be My Eyes,A great app for a great cause.,04/10/18 12:40,5
Be My Eyes,"I loved the idea of this application. It’s proved a great opportunity to help others. 
After using this app for several months, I realised that many of users used it for other purposes. So far I received four calls from different users, I can tell all of them are not blind because they asked silly questions about things they know all the details about.
Do not risk your privacy and don’t waste your time by using this fake app. I’m not against helping people in need, but this app is a joke. Try to find another ways to help people without risking your privacy.",12/09/20 21:20,1
Be My Eyes,It’s so simple to set up. I’m a seeing person so it actually takes quite a while to get your first call. But I definitely loved being able to help someone when I finally did.,06/25/23 13:20,5
Be My Eyes,"I had this app for months waiting for a call. I missed one because it was at 3 am and was quite sad. I had been feeling guilty, for not being able to help that day, but today, I picked up and it’s so so easy. Once you click on the notification, it opens up like a FaceTime, except only you can see them. Then the visually impaired person will explain to you their needs. Mine was trying to figure out what to cook for lunch and I was reading to her what the boxes were and the instructions. It only took a couple minutes but it means a lot to take time out of your day to help. I am awaiting my next call already!!",11/06/22 6:35,5

I have had this app about a year and only been used that once... still an A+++++ app and idea!!! Maybe you can come up with ansign language interpreter!!!,06/06/21 8:02,5
BlindSquare,"This app is pretty good but you have to know where you’re going in order for this app to be successful, I would like to see when it announces upcoming streets what side of the street they are on Briggs ample if you were walking along the right hand side of the street and it says Apple Street 10  o’clock it would be nice to know if it’s only on your left-hand side or straightahead of you anyway other than that pretty good app besides getting turn by turn",02/06/19 14:11,4

wrong hands! No doubt it's a great app. But let's say someone downloads it, 
guids the other person wrong and miss treat him/her. Of course they won't 
have a good day! I hope you guys would absolutely Pay attention to this

Be My Eyes,"App conflicts with Bluetooth connections. Seems to act as an always-on audio source, which among other things means that you can't pair with more than one device.

Be My Eyes,"Honestly, a joy to be apart of this program.",11/30/21 16:08,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing in theory, but volunteers need a do not disturb setting for off hours when they're either sleeping or not available. That would also cut back on the amount of users you'd need to ping at one time. Four stars until something like that is implemented.",01/23/19 3:41,4
Be My Eyes,I love this app. I’m a volunteer and I’ve helped with 5 or so calls. When I first downloaded the app I waited months for my first caller!! It brings me joy the amount of volunteers out there ! I enjoy helping answer questions that are simple for some and impossible without this app for others. Such an awesome app. People from everywhere! Coolest idea ever you should be a volunteer too !,06/05/22 3:12,5

Be My Eyes,"works well, not intrusive, no battery drain",08/28/20 20:30,5

Seeing AI,"When you open the app if there was a better way to access channels by gesture it would be very beneficial. 

My blind friend received notification of software update. App became unusable because she can’t see where to press in the notification box to remove the notification and begin using the app. Either don’t have the notification appear or give a gesture to accept or dismiss the notification to begin using the app. 

Pause button too close to channel bar. Accidental press too easy. 

This is a wonderful app and amazing technology but there are several improvements that would actually help blind people.",05/18/18 16:48,4

It sounds like basically they can gather all information from your smartphone about what websites you visit, what apps you use, and so on, and sell and use that to target marketing and ads to you. This is a major concern, and makes it seem like maybe that is the main purpose of this, especially given a lot of the reviews saying they have not received any requests from help from any blind people.",01/26/15 16:00,2

Be My Eyes,Fantastic app for helping others. The fact that there are so many more volunteers opposed to those who need assistance gives me hope for humanity...,08/15/21 1:04,5
Be My Eyes,I have gotten 3 calls since signing up to help someone. The first call the video kept freezing and we had to disconnect. The 2 other times  the app wouldnt let me pick up the calls.,09/24/24 17:17,1

Seeing AI,"This app is truly amazing. First drive was more than I could have imagined.  It's fast, intuitive and snappy. As a parent of a blind child, I am hopeful that this technology continues to evolve. Special thanks to Microsoft, Saqib Shaikh and team that made this possible. You are all amazing!",07/13/17 10:10,5

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded “Be my eyes” yesterday. Got my first phone call today from a sweet girl who was trying to find a salad in a grocery store refrigerator. I could tell that she was nervous when we couldn’t find it right away. I told her, “Hey, don’t worry, I’m here! No matter how long it takes!”
We finally found her salad with the help of a store employee. Turns out that they had rearranged where she usually was able to find it. It was in the very back! 
I not only appreciated the call, but I got to experience a very helpful employee who was extremely kind when helping her. It showed me that there are actually kind people who are willing to help, and that we are all in this together. 
5 stars. This made my day. :) :) :)",09/10/19 3:13,5
Be My Eyes,I have reported this twice. Is this common? I answered my first call. Happy to be able to help someone. Well the help this person wanted is for another profession. My caller was masturbating. Is this common? Should I be expecting this with every call. I feel completely foolish for thinking I could just be a good person. I hope no one else answers a call like this.,11/10/22 0:52,1
Be My Eyes,"I really like the idea, and I did recieve a call, but I could not hear the person on the other end and had to guess what she needed and hope she could hear me. I looked it up, and no audio is a common issue and if it were fixed I would be happy to use this app, but since I can't ensure they'll be able to hear me, I don't want to waste someone's time. Fix the technical issues, and this app can really do good in the world.",05/15/22 12:17,2

the notifications and calls came through. 9pm to 8am does not work for me 
as I work 12 hour night shifts from 7pm to 7am. Great concept, but for 
someone like me.. being called at 11am is the equivalent of being called at 
11pm.. change this and I will be happy to contribute!",07/08/18 0:08,3

NaviLens,Not a good App,05/10/22 23:57,1
Be My Eyes,"I love this app! It gives you the opportunity of stopping your everyday routine to help someone in need.

Be My Eyes,"This app is really sweet!! I saw it all over TikTok!! It was a really smart way to promote it, because it definitely worked. I don't get very many people calling me, it takes a few months, but that's alright! I'm glad people are getting the help they need!! xx",02/17/23 15:33,5

Be My Eyes,Great app,10/23/19 6:11,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"I have been using this app for a while now, and I love what It does. Reading denominations on money is great. Reading the tiny print they use in product manuals (pamphlets) is impossible these days, so I usually take a picture and then blow it up so I can read it. This app has put an end to that. I are hold it up for a second, and it starts reading. You don't even have to keep it on the page once it starts reading My problem, the explore mode won't shut up. I can't find the setting for slow",06/30/20 19:09,4

Be My Eyes,"I came across be my eyes by accident and downloaded it just off reading how it’s used to help people with vision impairments. As a natural helper this APP is the best APP ever ! I love that someone thought to include people who can’t see and help them connect with strangers in a friendly but helpful way. After getting my first call my heart was full of joy! The woman i assisted was so pleasant i was so honored to help her in such a way. 

I’m grateful that i came across this app and want to say thank you for making a difference in the world 🫶",11/03/22 23:08,5
TapTapSee,Beautiful app! Not sure how many ppl know but TapTapSee will identify your money for you which is primarily what I use it for. It comes in handy for other things too like to find out the color of your clothes or reading food labels.,02/01/17 20:11,5
Be My Eyes,"I only learnt about this app after watching a video from a visually impaired person talking about tools they use to help them. When i looked into it i was so impressed that there was an app like this so signed up to help! 
I answered my first call yesterday and it made me feel so happy knowing i’ve helped someone even just a little to be able to he more independent! 
This app is brilliant and i would recommend it!",07/28/20 0:16,5
Be My Eyes,I think this is a great app! Although it may be a good idea to add the option to choose whether you receive messages/calls only so people who may experience phone anxiety can also help out as much as possible.,04/14/19 5:33,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"It is such a great app. Please add other currency such as Indonesian currency, Rupiah.",05/23/22 1:34,4

Seeing AI,"Strangely I have more luck recognising handwriting than documents. Great for faces though.
Ideas for future development:
1. Ability to recognise pets / check where they are in the room (good for cats that are silent and don’t come when called) as currently only works with people.
2. QR reader
3. Ability to describe scenes on screenshots from websites / photos already in phone memory.",05/04/19 2:09,4
Be My Eyes,This app connects sighted volunteers with low-vision people. I enjoy the low-effort high-payoff community service aspect the most. It's easy for me and invaluable to those who need just a little support to be fully independent.,09/22/22 18:04,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing concept! Love being able to contribute,02/10/21 0:43,5
Be My Eyes,"So far I’ve answered 4 calls for service with be my eyes, and each one has been very different with very different people, and each time has been a new challenge for us to overcome. Despite the challenge we overcame, made conversation and jokes along the way, and in the end they got what they needed and I was able to help them. All in all, it’s an amazing experience and nothing beats helping others.",07/09/24 1:15,5

OneStep Reader,"The fact that such an app exists at all to help those of us who can’t see well enough to read print is worthy of three stars, so I am grateful we have this tool. That said, this behaves more like a free app than one I spent $100 on. First of all, where are the updates??? We are coughing up the money, so you should be providing frequent updates. My biggest issue with the app is trying to line up the shot when scanning a document. The phone vibrates wildly, which I gather is supposed to indicate whether or not it is being held at a level angle over the page, but I find this almost impossible to get just right and more annoying than helpful. Can’t alignment of the page be done electronically during image processing? Secondly, I wish it behaved like banking apps when you are taking a picture of a check for an electronic deposit. You simply hold the phone over the document and move it around a bit until it is lined up. Once it is aligned, the app automatically takes the picture for you and processing begins. For $100, why isn’t this app doing the same? The technology obviously exists. Instead, it is a tedious game of guess-and-check where I have to continuously press one of the volume buttons to get a status update on whether or not I am lined up. Even The motion of reaching to press this button makes it harder to steady the phone, so I never feel like I get a really good shot. These announcements should happen automatically. Finally, the documents generated, while often producing some readable text, usually also have a mess of garbled text and random symbols, making it very hard to find what you are looking for. I know the technology exists nowadays for OCR processing to work much more smoothly than this, and again, at the price you are asking, your app needs to be a lot better. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t have purchased this app and would have just settled for something free that basically gets the job done comparably well.  Many blind and visually impaired people are on fixed incomes, so taking a chance on something like this with no option of getting your money back is a big deal.",04/14/18 10:29,3
Be My Eyes,thanks to this app i can help the blind,10/28/19 16:33,5

Be My Eyes,"Thank you to all of the incredible and very kind volunteers. You have all been so wonderful, there might have been two or three, who simply did not sound as if they had the time or interest in helping, however, for every other person who has been so helpful and generous, you have made a huge difference. Being blind has its challenges, but I hear tell you that as a blind person, at one time having sight, this is a wonderful program. You have been helpful, looked out for colors, helps locate, it’s just been wonderful. Thank you so much.",07/21/23 15:36,5
Be My Eyes,"As soon as I downloaded this app and opened it, all my contacts were deleted. I have all the numbers, but no names to them, so I don't know who most of them are. I deleted the app and tried numerous other ways to get them back but nothing is working. Help!",01/20/15 1:13,1

Envision AI,"I'm confused: when I want to find an object, the app opens a list of objects for me to choose from. Well, I can't read a list!! And what if I'm in a grocery store and want to find, lets say a cereal among the wide array of boxes on the shelf- how do I do that without the option to open a microphone and speak what I need. Hardly makes sense as a feasible solution for the blind. I installed Envision AI on Android device with Android 12 update.",04/30/22 12:55,2
Be My Eyes,I really recommend this app to all. Sighted people can help blind people become even more independent through technology. What's not to love about it?,08/21/19 13:33,5
Envision AI,"But... Seeing AI is free for iOS devices. And is Envision AI’s main ‘competition’. I get it though, not every company can afford making free apps (like Microsoft can). That said, the prices are fair. 
I like everything else so far, and I’m sure it’ll get better and better with each update.",11/14/18 9:20,4
Be My Eyes,"This is such a wonderful gift! When you get a call, answer quickly or another volunteer will get it. You will speak to a blind person on video who may ask simple questions about medicine bottles or what shirt matches their tie. It is a great feeling to be there for someone. I've been a member for about 8 years and have only answered about 4 calls.",04/10/22 23:50,5

Be My Eyes,Good app,05/01/20 0:27,5
OneStep Reader,"I bought this app in part because Google Drive was advertised as a backup option, but to my frustration and $99.00 lighter wallet, turns out that wasn’t’ the case. Highly disappointing. Only offering Dropbox feels so 2012. It is very limiting and available storage is very small when comparing to Google Drive and even OneDrive/OneDrive for Business or iCloud.
There are a couple of buttons where it would seem that a better and more streamlined user experience could be had by converting them to picker items with Voiceover. Mainly in the speech and document language buttons on the scanned document page. Currently, you have to double tap through to get the the next screen where you interact that the picker options anyway. Just feels like an unnecessary step.
I’d be happy to revise my rating with a future update if some of these issues are improved upon and other cloud storage options are provided than just Dropbox.",09/20/15 21:07,4
TapTapSee,Honestly it's not that accurate. I tried to put crayons in front of it so I could tell me. It wouldn't. It's not that accurate and then you could only use the back camera. And it just doesn't really pick up on stuff. Maybe if it was developed more than maybe I would try it again but this is not that accurate. Honestly I wouldn't really recommend it. I love where it's headed though. I really do. But I just think that it should be developed more maybe add some more features also for the video fun,12/27/23 23:21,2

OneStep Reader,I have tried tons of OCR apps in the past and they have all flopped. Total fail. Will this app is so much different. It tells you what it sees and doesn't see and the tilt feature is really cool also. It is spot on with its OCR. I'd say about 99% correct. Don't let the price tag scare you. I promise you'll find lots of ways to use this app. It actually just about to save my life when I was able to read a medicine label I would not have followed proper direction since the pharmacist never told me… Just do it you will not regret it.,10/15/14 12:55,5

To see the amount of volunteers and how much help, big or small, this app is providing (FOR FREE) is incredible. As a volunteer, this service makes me smile. When I got my first call, I was nervous, but after helping the person on the other end, I couldn’t help but smile. I even got a little choked up. It just felt so good to help. 

So download this app. It doesn’t take up much space. It works well. It doesn’t spam you with notifications. But when the notification does show up, if you get the chance to answer, it could be the best thing you do all day.",01/23/20 5:02,5

Seeing AI,"Unlike previous attempts at barcode scanning, this app is doing a great job of finding the code without needing to be placed precisely on it. It didn't actually know what a few of my foods were, but switching to short text recognition gave me enough info to sort it out quickly. Having both options in one app is wonderful. As for the facial recognition, the jury is still out. With my first picture it guessed I was ten years older than I am, so I'm waiting for it to apologize. It did improve with better lighting, thank goodness!",07/12/17 18:58,5
Cash Reader for the Blind,"While I was at first reluctant to sign up for another subscription app, I relented and glad I did. The app has a clean interface and a host of interesting options under Settings. Best of all, it works reliably and very responsive. It’s reassuring to know that I can reliably tap into my secret cash stash with confidence without sighted assistance. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a secret.",04/28/22 14:58,5

Be My Eyes,"I received my first call today and I truly can say, he made my entire day so much better by his reaching out via this app. The mere fact that a program like this exists is so powerful in strengthening the human to human interaction that this world is lacking. Just a simple question of “can you please read this label for me?” Gave me  such purpose to answer that for him. Truly an emotional and very rewarding app that is doing so much “good” each and every day. I just want to say THANK YOU, creators, for existing and providing a safe place for everyone to ask for help in a meaningful and monumental way.

Be My Eyes,"Such a wonderful app, it truly is. I had the pleasure of helping a non sighted member recently and I can honestly say it was one of the most positive experiences I’ve had in recent times. If you’re looking for a reason to download, just do it. To be able to help someone, no matter how small the task or question, it is so rewarding and heart-warming. It takes only a few minutes to set up, and when you answer a call, it may only take a few minutes, but it could mean the world to the person you’re answering to! The first call can be scary, but part of the fun is forgetting your own problems and making a difference for a non sighted person who needs your help. It feels amazing to be able to make a difference to someone’s life even when you’re sat on the sofa, this app is changing the world. Would 100% recommend to anyone, everyone; just do it.",12/15/18 14:37,5
Be My Eyes,I have read a pill bottle and an oven setting and both made this empty nester feel like a million dollars. The challenge is to verbally coach the blind person to align the phone with the object so it can be seen! It helps so much for either the camera or the object to be stationary so that the coaching is for only one item. I am a quiet person and this gives me an opportunity to help people in short bursts. Brilliant app!,10/22/22 13:05,5

Please, help someone else today - it will help you, too!!! 🥰 For people who say that the answer button is unresponsive: A few people I know think that this is most likely due to others trying to answer that same call, at the same time ...

My mother has been completely blind her entire life and she knows better than anyone that technology for the visually impaired is years behind what it should be. I'm predicting it will take the blind community time to even become aware that this app exists. What I can say for sure is that my mom is extremely grateful for an app like this. She actually has facetimed me in the past to ask me what color shirt would look best with her outfit, or to have me read a soup can label, and so on. Blind people NEED apps like this, and you don't know how much you'll be helping by downloading this app. It only takes a minute out of your day to make a huge difference in someone's life. So, I encourage you to keep the app if you can spare the storage space instead of getting discouraged and deleting it.",03/19/15 19:11,5

The only thing that I would say I would like to have if it’s even possible is I have a very hard time with expiration dates I always have to have someone come down and read it for me and I have not found a single app that has been able to find and read expiration dates don’t know if that’s possible if not that’s fine it would just be nice thing to have I’m even very skeptical about eating things in my fridge and pantry just because I don’t know if it’s any good or not and I don’t wanna have to call someone to say hey can you come tell if this is good or not so it definitely is a real problem for me don’t really know what else to do so if that is a feature that is possible to be added it would be great but again I very much love this app it has made my life so much easier thank you again,04/25/21 0:33,5

Seeing AI,"the updates keep getting better, from the jumping text, they fixed it, to the document channel being sluggish and now that's fixed. microsoft is doing an excellent job and no account needed and this all free. love it. my one thing is I would love the seen preview and where you share photos from the share sheet to have a way to interact with the AI like you can now in the document channel. these guys brought much more rich descriptions to the seen and share sheets, but theres no interactions with it, if you could ask it followup you would have a 5 star app I think. edit, you can now ask seeingAI questions about your photo, this is fantastic.   I have no problem recommending this app and the other thing i'll say is working with microsoft's seeingAI staff via email you get quick responces. I do not work with them but what I mean is like emailing them, their turnaround time has ben rather snappy I feel. they seem to really get blind people with their seeingAI here and its just getting better.edit, as of Version 5.5, the interface is much more streamlined, I didn't think it possible to make it any easier but they did, and they blended a few channels into one, like the read tab is short text and document all in one and you also have the option to toggle with a button with document alignment and you can even take a photo in that tab. theres so much more they did and its just excellent and we still get access to the older stuff. I love the describe tab updates, now you get a rich description right out of the gate when you snap a photo or load one. its excellent thank you so much Microsoft and team over at seeing AI.",02/08/25 8:05,5

Nonetheless, I can hardly ever answer calls because the button to do so is unresponsive when tapped.

The app doesnt run on the background , when I hear audio from PDF , the app needs to be unlocked, which drains my battery. 2. It is not continuing from where left, always I should remember the page I left and go-to the related page , very annoying. Otherwise this app does what is expected.

Seeing AI,Absolutely love this app! Didn’t even think there was apps out here like this until today when I was on the phone with a friend. She told me that some of her friends use it and I had never heard of it. Only problem I have is with the face recognition… The age it gives you in face descriptions is way off. For example I  used a photo of my boyfriend earlier that was in my camera roll and had it describe the photo. It said he was 35 based on facial looks. I might not see very well but I know my boyfriend is only 23 and doesn’t look nowhere near that old… That need some improving other than that the app is amazing! Thank you!,02/14/18 18:07,4

Be My Eyes,"I am changing my review from five stars to one star because of a few issues.
One. Camera. I’m not exactly sure why but when I have called volunteers, they say that my camera is having focus issues.
Too. Ringer sound when trying to connect to a volunteer. I’m not sure what’s going on but I have to press the volume up buttons on my phone to even find out if the ringing sound is going on. I’ve checked all settings and everything seems to be correct. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled this app with no success.
Three. Contacting Be My Eyes themselves for other organizations to be included such as Logitech, Bose, and even Apple accessibility to name a few. Whenever I email Be My Eyes, all I get in reply is just the same email that I’ve sent to them with information about the operating system I’m running on my iPhone which at the current time of this writing is iOS 18.3 and I’m on an iPhone SE three.

My only complaint is that we can’t wear a camera or and it is in progress to use the world setting for indoor use only at the moment it would make sense to me that person could make maybe glasses that you could wear with the success of the Seeing AI app in them or you could hold your phone up and it could describe the world around you, and if it could get good enough at this, you could walk around and be told some of how to get around you were still use your cane with the other hand, it also might be good if you had a FaceTime option and you had a live person that could come through and see what you’re looking at on the phone when your loan so they can describe things for you should be another good option for them to add and how come, they’re not helping the blind get those cars that I should do drive we’re supposed to be helping the disabled I approve of the Seeing AI app if you could get the cameras in glasses and have that app and maybe a FaceTime person person with ice blind could possibly navigate streets they would still want to pay attention with their cane",12/30/23 2:32,5

Be My Eyes,"The app does not detect if a voice call is in progress. The app rings in between a call and can disturb the user and the person requiring assistant will not get through, hope the app diverts call to another volunteer if one person is busy",08/05/22 23:48,5

TapTapSee,"I cannot emphasize enough what an amazing app this is! It works perfectly. I tried it with many different objects, and it recognized all of them. Truly a marvel for blind people. Comes in handy tremendously. However, I am not fond of having to purchase picture packages in order to have continual use of the product. I feel a flat rate would be a much more efficient Way to be charged. I'd pay $5-$10 for this app but don't think I should have a continual charge from month to month or as a pay as you go status. Again, wonderful app… Totally perfect! Hope you decide to make a paid version",01/13/14 20:47,4
Be My Eyes,"I’m a volunteer and have been for quite a while. It’s such a blessing to be able to help someone else be independent.

About 1x a month I get a Be My Eyes request. It’s a simple problem for me to answer—Is this a $10 bill? Is this my new Medicare card? What is the setting on xyz? The question takes less than 45 seconds. How easy! 

I also love that we’re freeing up family members/ care givers. If you’ve ever been a caregiver for a few hours or years, you know that any trusted help is appreciated. 

I’m so happy to be a part of Be My Eyes. Tell your friends/ family to join if they need help or to volunteer.",04/20/19 12:13,5

Be My Eyes,I helped someone yesterday that I felt was in a bad situation. I tried to email for support. They said there was nothing they could do and said they felt this person was somewhat able to manager themselves. I can tell you now... That I am concerned because they can't handle themselves. They were in a very dangerous environment. I am very disappointed in this app and lack of concern over its users.,05/18/22 13:20,1

Be My Eyes,I’m so happy there’s an app where I can help people when they need it. It makes me feel good when I actually help people out on this app. I helped a blind man with his microwave the other day and he was so happy that I was patient enough to help him. Sometimes it can be difficult because the camera isn’t clear enough but over all it’s just a blessing to be apart of this.,05/14/21 23:51,5

muted 24/7. It is not a notification that could be picked up by my watch 
its merely a NON-LOUD call tone. Needs a fix. Quick. 1: select your own 
ringtone. 2: continues phone notification, so smart watches can pick it up. 
3: LOUD ring tone (edit) : this might be gigantic hoax.",08/17/18 5:25,3

I was *finally* by my iPad at just the right moment, ready with headphones and a stable seat/table, so I just had my first call to help with. We jumped right into it with no introductions needed. It was such a heartwarming moment I got to assist with: helping to spell out letters in a book for a young girl and her sight impaired father. I can just imagine how needed a service like this would be for seemingly simple moments in a sight impaired life. As long as I have it, I will gladly use my sight to assist people, just as I hope others will help me if mine goes. Thank you to the creators for such a thoughtful app.",05/02/19 23:53,5

Seeing AI lets me leave the document I'm scanning in one place while I adjust the camera angle.

Be My Eyes,This is an incredible idea.,06/06/20 10:17,5
Be My Eyes,"Stop giving one star or so cause 'there's not enough blind people'. Like, uhm, what? Isn't not being fast enough to be the first one to accept a call a good sign? The app is working just fine and supporting the blind well. I can understand y'all do want to help, but they know best when and how often they need help, don't push them into 'needing' help!",02/15/19 14:57,5

Be My Eyes,♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ LOVE THIS APP ! I think it's such a good idea I know I absolutely love when I get a call & get to help someone. Everyone has been so nice & I'm happy to help. Don't worry your 📱 won't ring 24/7 there's a ton of volunteers I've had it for months & gotten 3 calls. It's all been stuff I take for granted like being able to read my oven temperature or find a specific button. I think it's a really sweet & thoughtful app I've recommended it to all my friends ♥️,02/06/25 6:54,5

Great app, Microsoft! But please add support for Wingdings!",07/17/20 2:33,1
Lookout - Assisted vision,"Would be great if it could also tell the colors especially if the color of the object is simple (e.g. a black chair) or if it is a clothing item. Or even having a separate mode just for colors. It s pretty impressive how many objects it can recognize but simple task as telling which color is this item is not implemented. It s a shame. My mum is blind, it would be great if she could use this app to help her pick her outfits.",01/01/22 4:56,3

Seeing AI,I'm visually impaired and I always had to ask people to read things to me or discribe things for me. That wasn't always easy because there wasn't always people around me. But when I found this app I was like yay this will help me a lot! And it is helping me so much! Now when I want something discribed for me all I have to do is go to Seeing AI. Thank you so much for making this app!,09/26/21 18:05,5
Be My Eyes,I used this app for the first time a few days ago as I wanted to find the model number of batteries. I am Blind. I was amazed at how easy it was to get through to the volunteer and how eager he was to help. I would highly recommend anyone trying the app and if you are cited maybe you could consider volunteering?,03/19/18 8:07,5
Be My Eyes,Was looking forward to getting a call and then when i did the app just didnt want to load. I am extremely disappointed in this app because I was not able to help someone and worse that person wasnt able to be helped.,06/22/21 19:33,1

Be My Eyes,Amazing idea with an easy to use app. 😊,01/16/19 13:41,5

Be My Eyes,"Great idea, but there really should be a way to set an ""off hours"" for when I can't receive calls. It's rare enough to get a call so it's much more disappointing to get the opportunity to help at the wrong time with no way to prevent this. Maybe a simple homescreen widget button that adds 1-hour to my ""off hours"", or a homescreen widget with a simple on-off toggle for ""off hours"".",06/11/23 4:26,4

Envision AI,Good application,11/01/18 12:48,5
Seeing AI,"Just as good as it's iOS counterpart. If you want to tell anybody about the app, be sure to let them know that it's mistakenly all one word as listed in the Play store. On the website, however, it is two words so that made it very, very difficult to find in the Play store. Really great app, though. Very snappy and responsive.",12/11/23 22:08,5

Be My Eyes,"Beautiful! I love the idea of this app and was just thinking something like this needs to exist for those trying to travel on our horrendous trains services and even airports, when this app was mentioned on the programme I was watching! My only concern about this being an open community app is that it leaves open for trolls. My suggestion to make it more secure would be to register a face photo and Passport page to ensure people are genuine and can be traced if they abuse this system or people.",01/14/20 2:58,5
Be My Eyes,"I absolutely love this app. The ability to help a total stranger in need is so very rewarding. I love to help people and this gives the opportunity to do so. There are more volunteers than blind so it can take a while to get a call but, when you do get a call it’s worth the wait!",09/08/22 23:08,5

It reads shampoo and conditioner bottles and other plastic bottles with flat surface.

Con 
It doesn't like glas bottles or other containers that are round. It also has a hard time recognizing faces. Please fix those issues.",07/13/17 1:43,3

Be My Eyes,this garbage won’t even load. I was so excited to try this out!,01/22/20 19:29,1
Be My Eyes,I hope this app is advertised to schools for blind and as widely as possible. I got my first call yesterday and it went really well! A married couple who are both visually impaired needed my help reading some insurance cards. They were so impressed by the app service and we chatted a little bit after. This app is a great idea!

Be My Eyes,"I am a sighted volunteer. In the time I have been on this app I have had 
two calls. It was a great feeling being able to help someone. Both ladies 
that I helped were friendly, gracious and grateful. My first call was to 
help someone reading a temperature gauge. And the second call was helping 
an elderly lady to set the settings on her washing machine. Took a little 
bit of time but we did it. She then asked me where I was, and told me where 
she was. And we ended up being several provinces away from each other. We 
talked about different things and had a really nice little chat about the 
different places we lived and of course the very Canadian weather, the 
wildfires over where she lives, and in general how wonderful this app was 
for not only helping people but connecting people. She was so very thankful 
and in the end it was like talking to an old friend across the distance of 
several provinces. For the few minutes it took out of my busy day to help 
them with theirs this is a great thing..",08/16/18 18:09,5

Be My Eyes,I am writing this after more than six months of using it. Earlier there were bugs & glitches in the app but now the functionality & quality has improved by leaps & bounds. It is great to help someone in need of assistance & I have assisted over 40 people till date & today I addressed a meeting of principles of blind persons colleges in New Delhi over the app. They throughly tested the app & were super impressed by its privacy & functional features.,09/26/23 1:45,5
OneStep Reader,It doesn't seem to work unless you pay $100! I'm severely visually impaired and the app doesn't seem to work and if so it's so confusing I can't seem to get it to work. Nor do I have $100 to put towards an app. Definitely uninstalling.,08/04/23 11:36,1

Be My Eyes,I downloaded the app because of my niece I love being able to help people. I wish the video quality was better it makes it hard to read a lot of labels when it looks grainy,01/04/24 0:00,4
Be My Eyes,"Got a call, but there was no sound. I can hear the test call, so the app has the right permissions, but i could not hear the caller. The video was incredibly blurry, and they seem to know this is an issue because there is a ""snapshot"" feature which is a bandaid over the real issue of call quality. After the call, in the screen that asks if there were any problems, I tried to say that there were, but the button does not work, and I can see other reviwers had the same experience. Fix it!",04/26/23 1:21,1
Be My Eyes,"I have been a volunteer for a year. I have received 3 calls total. 2 while I was at work anf unable to answer. The 3rd I answered, but the video did not work, the audio was breaking up and then we were disconnected.

I was connected with this woman trying to get into her laptop and couldn’t see the screen to figure out why she couldn’t log in. She had previously called 4 other people before me and they all told her they couldn’t help. 20 long minutes later I helped her get into her email through her phone for this code, helped guide her finger to the touch screen to be able to enter said code (she didn’t have a mouse), then reset her computer login password. 
When I tell y’all I legit cried after I hung up, like ugly cried because I was so happy I was able to help this random stranger. Whoever invented this app rocks and deserves an award!!",07/10/19 18:32,5
Seeing AI,"This app is literally a dream come true for not only people who are blind or low vision but also for the profoundly dyslexic or otherwise print disabled people. My son is profoundly dyslexic and despite being 14 years old his ability to read print with his eyes is less than a first grade equivalent.  We have tried and use many apps and other technologies to help him access the world of print. Despite his struggles, he is a voracious consumer of audiobooks and this app allows him to access print around the environment with so much less effort than other apps. It also has very good accuracy. I also think the facial expression recognition feature has potential to assist people with Autism. Frankly, this app is just plain wonderful!!!!",11/14/19 1:36,5

OneStep Reader,This app use to be really good but now when I have to scan more than one document the app keeps  closing and I have to reopen it and scan the document again. This happens every time and it is a waste of time to keep doing this. This app doesn’t keep pace with the latest updates because it hasn’t updated.,10/30/19 0:23,1

Be My Eyes,"I just tried Be My Eyes and the connection was fine. Good audio, video worked, the call wasn't dropped. Didn't take very long to find a helper. Would do this again when I'm in need of something more detailed than identifying an object, which TapTapSee is great for. They serve different purposes and I'm happy to have both available to me.

P.S. Was on my DSL connection at home, so the speed/latency was reliable and low, respectively. I don't have a fast connection at all, but judging by what my helper said, the video was good enough to describe things to me.",01/20/17 7:48,5
Seeing AI,"I like the over all use of the app, but I've been having some trouble with the app lately. When I'm using the seen preview I try to take a second picture and for some reason it says that there is a problem and to try again in a moment but next time I try it stops working all of the sudden and it won't say anything when I go to the other channels.",10/31/19 18:22,3

OneStep Reader,Since updating to 11.2.5 . I can no longer safe knfb files. This app is in my opinion one of the greatest OCR recognition out there very pricy but worth it👍🏾. But at 99.99 there should not be any issues with iOS updates. Again! The save knfb file feature crashes every time I try to save a file using iOS 11.2.5 .

They were rude and called me very nasty things. It also took 15 minutes for me to connect with them. It then took me another 15 minutes to connect with someone who told me where the controller really was.,11/30/15 20:12,2
Be My Eyes,Many thanks for everyone here 💙,10/21/18 5:35,5
OneStep Reader,Application needs continuous updates. Needs a massive overhaul. It keeps crashing on open,07/21/19 22:09,2
Be My Eyes,"As with other recent reviewers, wonderful concept with subpar execution on my phone (Pixel 4a). Maybe there's a bug that's currently causing so many calls to be fail to connect. Feels horrible to get so excited to help someone only to have to tell them you can't see their video and can't help them. Would love to give a 5 star review if the bug is fixed!",09/02/21 16:36,2
Be My Eyes,I never get notifications if someone is calling. i’ve had the app for about three months now and i’ve gotten one notification about someone calling. I don’t even get the option to help someone. I love the idea and I think it’s great but i’d like to get the option to help :/,09/17/19 5:22,4
Be My Eyes,amazing app! had it for ages and only had two calls of about 5 mins each so it doesnt take up much of your time but hopefully makes a positive impact in someones life :),11/18/18 13:01,5
Be My Eyes,Great idea but just collecting dust. I had the app about a month without getting any notifications or calls I love the idea of this but maybe there is a app issue or more than enough have signed up and it over crowded with people who want to help but that's not a bad thing if that's the casr,09/09/21 17:35,4
Be My Eyes,WhatsApp,08/19/24 2:50,5
Be My Eyes,This is an amazing app to help in any way possible,02/11/21 1:12,5
NaviLens,This app seems really cool. I just wish that I could get the labels printed out on stickers so I would not need to have a sighted person cut the labels out for me. I would probably give all 5 stars if more companies would use this on their packaging.,08/24/24 12:39,4
Be My Eyes,"I've got my own disability which leaves me unable to assist people in a physical way. Be My Eyes has enabled me to help others in a much more personal and tangible way than by simply writing a check. Please consider adding this app and being someone's eyes.

I get 4-5 calls per year, and wish I had more opportunities. I've had calls as simple as indicating the denomination of paper currency, to finding a small dropped item on the floor, even aiding someone navigating a journey of several city blocks to a specific building. The flashlight function is genius! Most of my callers live in the dark. The app will turn on the phone's flashlight so you can see more clearly. 

It feels so rewarding to know immediately that I've helped someone and made their life a little bit easier. Please consider joining me. Download the app, sign up, and assist someone today!",08/29/23 1:55,5
Be My Eyes,This is a great way to help others!,08/15/19 16:59,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is such a brilliant idea. Really easy to set up and then a call comes through, easy to answer and hopefully help the visually impaired person with their problem.

Be My Eyes,"I pride myself on my ingenuity on figuring things out, but those times when I'm proper stuck this such a great full back and anxiety blocker.

Volunteers are awesome to talk to, and it's great meeting so many kind and varied people. Really looking forward to the virtual volunteer coming into action, signed up for it awhile ago but it still says it's pending,",03/26/23 12:46,5
Be My Eyes,"I absolutely love this and thankful for the person or group of people who thought it up. I have helped over 5 people and I couldn’t be more happy to do it. I mean I just had like my 5th call since downloading this last year. This time it was a Haitian man trying to identify dishwashing soap. He was so happy. They were teaching him how to use it at a facility. It made my heart smile and such a good morning. Please everyone, download this app. It's little acts of kindness like this that makes a difference in the world. Happy Hump Day everyone. Peace & Love🌹💋",12/02/20 14:27,5

Be My Eyes,I'm so glad someone created this app. As a sighted user my only complaint is that I don't get many calls! The few I've received were short and easy to do. Picking up a call takes very little time but helps to someone else and enables them to be more independent. I've recommended it to our accessibility network at work.,01/28/20 11:44,5

Seeing AI,"I just downloaded this app, and so far, I’m really impressed with its functionality. Please keep it going! I’m not blind, nor is my dad, who I actually downloaded it for. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, which causes hallucinations, making it difficult for him to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. He once mentioned that he wished he could point his phone at something and have it tell him whether it was real. That led me to search for apps, and I came across this one.

We plan to use it during his episodes—either he can use his phone himself, or we, as caregivers, can assist him—so he can have confirmation of reality. I’m especially impressed with the describe feature and how detailed it is in explaining what’s being seen. So far, I’m really happy with it. Keep up the great work!",02/05/25 12:00,5

Be My Eyes,I am visually impaired but it’s not bad enough for me to need this app. I downloaded it just to have a look and I saw that there was no other way to ‘see’ things apart from calling.

Be My Eyes,This app is such a great idea! I’ve only had one call come through so far from a man needing help reading the security number on a new debit card (the rest of his card details were covered obviously). Stuck at home in lockdown so lovely to be able to give up a minute of my time to help someone. Only problem was the connection wasn’t great so took a while for the blurry camera to focus well enough for me to read but that can’t be helped!,02/13/21 3:32,5

Be My Eyes,"I have been honored to assist 2 people in the 2 months since I signed up. I was thinking it might be nice to allow users to select the “type” of person they would like to assist them. Women might prefer women for sensitive things, men too! Or offer volunteers to list areas of expertise for things like healthcare or home decor or cooking- stuff like that. I also love the idea of users being able to request someone specific if their situation isn’t urgent. I am so grateful to see technology used in this simple, human to human interactions.

This app helps me a lot with telling me what I have in the pantry and then I go take a picture of things in the store and it will tell me with voiceover and I can either get that item if it’s the right thing I want or not. Also, it helps me with knowing if it’s a one dollar bill or a five dollar bill or anything like that. And it is also good for taking pictures of electronics.

I thought it would probably be a while before I received a call for help, but I just got my first one.

Be My Eyes,"I signed up 8 or 9 months ago as a way to try and help make a difference in someone's life even if it's a small one like picking the right food up at the grocery store. I wish I could tell you how great this app is and how fulfilled I feel after helping someone but sadly I cannot. There is no way to email or report issues or bugs so now I'm left writing a bad review after another unsuccessful connection. The app never works, it crashes on almost every call. I've tried connecting to 9 people in 9 months and only 1 of those was what the blind would call successful. It was a poor connection and very grainy, it was very difficult to hear exactly what was being asked. But being the 1st time I figured it could only get better from there, but sadly I was mistaken. I have this love hate relationship with this app where every time it goes off I get a smile on my face knowing someone needs my help only to be disappointed time and time again when it doesn't work properly. The other reviews are clearly from people that work on the app and not actual users like I am otherwise you would hear more of the same. This app needs a lot of work and at best is only worth 1 star.",03/03/17 14:39,1

Seeing AI,"My brother is blind and has been living independently for a few years now. Occasionally I'll head over and get a few questions -- maybe which flavor of a product is which. Maybe he received a few dollars back and he didn't know which was the 5 and which was the 1.

This app is able to help him with almost all of those questions, help make his life a little easier, and move him closer towards independence.
It's very generous of Microsoft to offer this app for free to help the blind!",06/27/20 9:32,5

Seeing AI,"Pro’s -
• Does what it says, how it says without glitches or ads.
• Doesn’t try to profit off the disability of others, giving us what comes free to others.
Con’s -
• People Recognition has to be done by taking their picture & many refuse to allow that. It would be easier if it can be done by a previously taken photo. This way permission isn’t needed to know who is around you!
• Vague description on objects & animals. Would love to know if it’s my dachshund or Chihuahua eating or just came in, I already know both are dogs!
Tips -
• To be a navigational assistance as well can erase the need of multiple apps & can be the one stop shop for the blind!
• Adding the option to use previous taken photos to recognize those around us.
I have been blind 6yrs & have used this app for 4 of them years. Sometimes I forget I’m blind due to this app! I recommend it on every device with a blind operator!",01/14/21 1:12,4
Be My Eyes,I love this concept so much! Just got my first call and it feels good to help 🥰 what an easy good deed for the day,07/14/21 17:47,5
Envision AI,"Not at all impressed.  I downloaded this app on the basis it has now become free, and I will be deleting it just as quickly.  While the scanning function is good, features such as the person recognition is completely useless, even with a camera pointed directly at someone it failed to see that tere was someone there. Am yet to try the barcode scanner but I definitely would never have paid for this app.",07/24/22 0:51,1
OneStep Reader,Keep up the good work!,04/29/18 14:04,5
Be My Eyes,I’ve only have 2 calls I’ve answered.

Just here happy to be apart of someone’s journey 💪🏽👑,03/15/24 23:22,5

Be My Eyes,Great idea! Does not work for FoldZ,07/06/22 5:37,3
Be My Eyes,I got my first call after 2 years with this app and was IN TEARS because it wouldn't connect. I felt so helpless knowing someone was trying to get help and we couldn't get connected. Boooo!! How stressful this must be for the unsighted users. I'm still upset an hour later thinking about them and wondering if they were able to access help.,12/11/21 7:57,1
Be My Eyes,So great to easily help others!!!,09/15/19 11:46,5
Be My Eyes,My favorite app because it lets me be helpful to others. A great and super simple way to help with those things we take for granted daily.,10/12/18 0:58,5

Be My Eyes,This app is cloned,09/02/24 12:10,1
Be My Eyes,On my first call I helped someone make sure that their oven was preset to the correct temperature. I think this is a very rewarding app to install on your phone.,07/17/21 8:44,5
Be My Eyes,"I excitedly downloaded this app weeks ago.... That's it... Nothing else. No activity, no requests for assistance, nothing... Deleting!",01/29/15 0:46,1
Be My Eyes,this is a wonderful thing for wonderful people. great idea and it's very genuine!,05/21/19 15:08,5
Be My Eyes,"Great app, here's a tip: I've had the app for over a year and I just found that on Android devices your permissions can be removed from the app if it's not opened every few months. To get around this go into your settings and go to the Be My Eyes app settings, there should be a section for Permissions. Click that and make sure to turn off ""remove permissions if app isn't used"". This was causing my connection errors and was not allowing me to connect with calls. Hopes this helps!",12/23/21 10:33,4
Be My Eyes,It has been 10 months since I installed this app. In that time I have helped 1 person. It took all 10 months before it happened and that is a good thing. With over 4 million volunteers and that means there are plenty of people to help. I'll wait happily wait another 10 months if that's what it takes to be there for a stranger.,10/05/20 21:42,5
Be My Eyes,Iv doing two starts cus it seems like a great thing. But I had this app forever and never once did it get used.. I think the supply is way way higher then the demand for it .,02/28/22 11:07,2
Be My Eyes,This is a good way to give back to people and help those in need from the comfort of your house. You won't need to worry if you do not pick up the call immediately because there are sooo many other people that can help if you are unavailable,12/31/17 3:51,5
Be My Eyes,"What a wonderful idea, and so well implemented. Thank you for letting me help!",02/24/18 11:58,5
BlindSquare,I love this app! Really helps me feel that I know where I am traveling. Makes me very aware of my surroundings.,09/03/16 15:57,5
Seeing AI,"So useful in so many daily activities. Probably the most useful bits have been the text recognition for me, but there’s just lots of possibility here, and I hope the developers continue to imagine and grow the product! Thank you for making my life as a blind person, easier!",08/28/23 16:14,5
Be My Eyes,"The app is good with the really ironic exception that it is not designed with an accessible interface!? There is no dark mode, and lots of the text is really small and low contrast. Reading white on black is often much easier for visually impaired people, so please test it with us! This app has the potential to be really helpful, but it bugs me that they haven't considered the way VI users will interact with it",05/30/23 2:51,3
Envision AI,Munib Hayat good app very good reading software,08/17/22 20:06,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,The text and document reading features produce unintelligible gobbledygook. The Explore surroundings feature is hit or miss and can't be focused on particular items indoors. It may work better outdoors. Overall nearly worthless for my needs.,02/28/24 19:37,2

Be My Eyes,I felt bad I had to hang up on someone because I could not understand them or there question. I kept repeating myself but we weren't understanding each other. He asked if I have used Twitter and I haven't an I tried telling him that and he kept asking questions I had no idea about. All and all the app is amazing and I enjoy helping people it's just sad when you get the one you can't help.,07/13/21 11:24,5
Be My Eyes,It is a blessing to be able to help others and this app provides the avenue to do just that.,12/05/20 12:14,5

Envision AI,this app is accurate and a liberation from being dependent on those who can see.,06/25/23 13:17,5
BlindSquare,Great. Does exactly what it says it will do. Fully accessible. Easy to use and integrates well into other navigation systems. Give you a good sense of what's around you and guide to you to a destination using the clockface. Clearly is a mainstream application as well. Might do with either another version or renaming the product. Fantastic! Make it more attractive to people who are not blind and I think it's a real winner.,10/10/12 23:31,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"UPDATE: This is sadly no longer a usable app for me, now that navigation features have been added that prevent me from using it as a pedestrian crosswalk signal. Now when the app opens it is in a map view prompting you to enter a destination. It WILL NOT FUNCTION AS A PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL until you activate that feature. If you are a low vision user, it’s not prominent or obvious. If you are a VoiceOver user, good luck trying to get there while at a noisy intersection. I can’t open the app in advance because it drains battery really fast.

I previously had given this app a 5 star review. The developers had solicited the review, but it was an honest one. I’ll leave it below for reference of how great the app used to be, and I’m still giving it 2 stars in the hopes that it might become usable again someday.

PREVIOUS REVIEW: 
More reliable and easy to use than an APS. I’ve been so impressed with this app! It’s so easy to use even when the environment is too loud to hear VoiceOver speech — I can just say “Hey Siri, open OKO” and it immediately jumps into action with haptics and sounds giving me my own accessible pedestrian signal. I love the haptics because I can still get the crosswalk signal information while simultaneously focusing on the traffic sounds. It also saves me time because (1) I can get the visible pedestrian signal status as I’m approaching the intersection and (2) if I want to cross kitty corner and don’t have the walk signal in front of me I can quickly turn my phone to check if I already have the walk signal to cross in  the other direction. It has given me a lot more confidence and independence navigating my city after vision loss and makes crossing the street much more analogous to how I could when I was fully-sighted.",06/11/24 3:23,2
Be My Eyes,"I will admit, I do not use this app for the blogs or podcast links. I’ve looked through them, but never followed up. Recently, I took my first phone call and was able to help someone make a pizza. It was the highlight of my night. I love apps like this that make connecting with and helping others in this anger filled, polarized world possible and beautiful.",02/09/23 13:25,5
Be My Eyes,"Has no way to designated time of availability, and caused phone to stay in Bluetooth audio mode as if a call was occurring even when it wasn't.",09/28/24 19:28,1
Envision AI,very useful this software,06/06/22 9:28,4
Be My Eyes,"I just had my first phone call and I wish I could do 1,000 more. I love being able to assist others even with simple tasks such as setting up a coffee machine. It brings me to tears how happy I am helping in just the simplest ways. I recommend this app to everyone because there are many that need us and you can find joy in helping others.",07/20/23 1:42,5
Seeing AI,After last update the app crashes immediately in my iPhone X,10/12/20 7:46,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing concept executed perfectly. what a great app.,01/24/19 18:07,5
Be My Eyes,I would like to see a skills portion to the volunteers profile something along the lines of what you would be great at helping with. Such as I am very proficient with technical skills and think it would be awesome if someone needs help with a technical thing they could specifically ask for someone with better tech skills. I can see many other areas where this could be usefull and would love to see it in the future. Overall this app is absolutely amazing I cant believe what you guys are accomplishing with this wonderful app.,10/10/18 8:55,5
Be My Eyes,love the idea I hope I can help,10/10/17 6:51,5
BlindSquare,"Thank you very much from the bottom of my beating heart: this app makes me more social, now I can do anything by myself, I can go whatever I want to go, I don't need to call my friends and asking them about the directions, really it's very very very important for every blind in this world, specially with supporting different languages ☺️👍👍",10/28/14 3:48,5

Seeing AI,"Before now, all problems that I had run into seemed to be fixed, but now, I ran into an issue with a wrong product. I was looking for my members Mark onion powder, and instead of telling me that it was onion powder, it told me that it was GV thin spaghetti. I obviously knew that was not thin spaghetti, and decided to start opening packages to see what they were so that I could find the right thing. It turned out that what it told me was spaghetti, was the onion powder that I was looking for. it's fortunate for everybody in my household that I'm not the one with the cold that I was making soup for, or we could've ended up with something really off the wall in the soup because I wouldn't have been able to smell it. The problem is, when we run into a problem like this, there's no button to report a problem, so it's going to start telling everybody that members mark onion powder is great value thin spaghetti, which if you shake it, it's obviously not, and it's not even in a container that thin spaghetti would be in, but for somebody who has never cooked, or is just learning, they won't know that it's the wrong kind of package. Spaghetti is typically in cellophane or cardboard, and this giant thing of onion powder is a plastic container. This is something that we need. We need to be able to report a wrong product if it's telling us that it's one thing, when it isn't. I have known older people who store everything in the same place, whether it's edible or not, if it's kitchen related, it goes in the cupboard, regardless. I have known people who have stored rat poison in the same cupboard as spices because it's too high for kids to get into, and I would really hate for somebody to put rat poison in their food by accident because this app told them that it was something edible. I'm not one of these people, and don't even keep rat poison in my house, but unfortunately, I know people who do. I could see this being a deadly mistake if we don't have a place to report wrong product uPC's. also, in one developer response to somebody, it says go to seeingai.com to see improvements in the app, but that just takes us right back here to the App Store.",09/30/23 16:40,4
Be My Eyes,"This app is really cool. It's always good to use technology for helping others. Below are some suggestions from me (not sure if y'all already implemented it or not): 1. Rating system of the helpers. The goal is just to avoid crazy ppl trying to trap or do any non beneficial things to the blind people. 2. Maybe the app can also connect blind people to their nearest people around them. That way, if they need a direction, someone nearby can easily help navigating it.",04/08/19 17:26,5

Be My Eyes,"If you want random moments where you feel a great sense of purpose and pride in helping others this app is amazing. I’ve gotten and answered only 2 calls in almost a year of having the app, but it always makes me feel so good to do it. So admittedly it’s selfish reasoning, but doing selfish things that help others is still pretty cool.",10/04/22 2:43,5
Be My Eyes,"I’m a volunteer on the app and have only had a handful of calls in the past few months since I downloaded it. That makes sense, there’s almost 11 times as many volunteers willing to help than blind on the app. The world can be so ugly that those numbers alone are a beautiful thing.

The app is very easy to use as a seeing person. And I’m so grateful that it’s a free resource for whoever needs it.

To developers, for your consideration: the blind are not the only people who are visually impaired. This app could be used by people with schizophrenia or even drug-induced hallucinations to determine if what they’re seeing or hearing can be confirmed by a third party.

Very cool! Thanks for prioritizing humanity over profits, I’m honored to participate!",02/21/25 23:57,5

OneStep Reader,"I am blind; and, like thousands of others without vision now have no way to accurately read documents. For 3 years this app has worked great, and then started skipping words until it progressed to the point where it does not even open; $79. is too much to pay for something that just stops and does not come back on.

Supersense - AI for Blind,I just found this app through the Utah Council of the blind I am absolutely amazed I have not set up a subscription I am testing the free version to see how good it is and I am absolutely blown away I just read a package of quaker barley it read everything including the barcode the directions and the recipes on the front page bravo well done,03/08/22 9:13,5
Be My Eyes,"I know that these beautiful souls are greatful for us, but in actuality, I'm GREATFUL for them. When I get the notification I'm needed, that feeling alone makes my heart so full. Especially after losing my disabled child, I felt somewhat worthless and empty. I was so used to being a full-time caregiver for her. After losing her, I NEEDED to fill that void. So when I can help someone from this app, it gives me a sense I still belong. I'm so grateful to be able to help. It makes my day complete.",04/24/24 21:06,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app,11/01/19 16:39,5

Be My Eyes,The super application is very useful to me,10/06/17 21:15,5
OneStep Reader,"Two main issues I had were the need to double tap while holding the device still resulted in blurry pictures. The bigger issue, though, was that while reading, the recognised text is displayed on the screen. TalkBack can see there is text on the screen, so TalkBack also starts reading the text out but slightly behind KNFB's voice.  You can't make out what either voice is reading to you as they both do it together.",11/06/16 3:08,3
Be My Eyes,"I received an email with information about this app and checked it out. Wow!!! Having a visually impaired father who resides in a different city, this is an amazing app to aid him with his daily life. Equally amazing... I can volunteer to help others with the same app.",05/20/18 2:09,5
Be My Eyes,Easy to use. Great to be able to help people!,01/14/18 13:47,5

Seeing AI,Remember the days of standalone scanning machines and the minutes we had to wait for each single page of error filled  readings. This app is nothing short of miraculous and it's ability to read in real Time with 99% accuracy is nothing short of miraculous. Thank you Microsoft keep up the good work!

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded this app on a whim about a year ago, and expected it to be very buggy and not of much help to those who need it. I applied as a volunteer and the first call I received, I was able to help an older gentleman read a text. Since then, I’ve received a couple more calls and I’ve never felt more rewarded in my life. I know I’m not doing anything that deserves praise, but I am so grateful I get to help people in this way and I get to connect with people from around the world. I hope this app grows and expands, and can’t wait to see how it improves.",12/12/20 6:06,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I got the app before it got the app purchase update and it has come a long way.  Even before it had maps integrated it was amazing.  It’s very accurate and simple to use.  Very clear and has helped me safely cross streets at the right time.  But if I had to buy it now, I definitely would and I highly recommend it.  I will say, because of the maps, it eats battery life like nothing else and for some reason I think the directs are always for driving and not walking which needs to be fixed.  I use Apple Maps instead, so if that can get fixed, I’d say it’s perfect then.",11/26/24 1:29,5
Be My Eyes,My favorite app yet! It has provided me with the way that I can be a service of others in a convenient and interactive manner. I can not recommend this app enough!,08/23/18 23:50,5

Be My Eyes,"This app, along with Seeing AI, are by far the most valuable apps for the blind. Most useful of course, is the Be My AI tab on this app. As a blind person, this has provided me magnitudes more independence than anything else. The ability to know what I am looking at, has brought me so much freedom and inclusion that I cannot describe. I must point out a glaring shortcoming.The problem is that the app, in an effort to protect privacy, has not taken into account that if a blind person is asking something to be described, a sighted person could easily see this info. The app refuses to describe certain things and immediately suggests that I call a volunteer. We know we can call a volunteer, stop suggesting it at the end of EVERY response. I am blind and need to provide my credit card number to pay a bill or to see if the card is expired. The app will not give me any info for privacy reasons. It tells me to call a volunteer. Why would I allow a stranger to see my credit card? It would be more secure to have AI read it to me! Also describing people is invaluable to a blind person, and it refuses to give information on a persons appearance. how does it violate privacy when a sighted person can see the same person?
Also, I do not want to give a rating whether I had a good chat or not every single time. Overall, I like the app a lot, but need it to be more forthcoming in its responses.",07/23/24 22:02,5
Be My Eyes,"There should be an option, something like ""actively waiting for call"" I've only had one call in days.",05/24/23 18:40,4

When you do assist, talk to them. Let the person know what you see. Is the camera out of focus? Is the item out of view? Be their eyes and tell them what you see. 

Be patient, kind, and enjoy the experience of helping someone. 

This is a great app!",05/06/18 16:19,5
Be My Eyes,They are a really good company for helping the blind people good job,01/30/20 8:28,5

Be My Eyes,"It's a great idea, I haven't answered a call yet, but the only reason I gave 4 stars is because apparently the app has to be open to get calls, at least that's how I saw it works on my phone. I left the app open and I got my first call in the morning (I didn't receive any since I downloaded the app) and while I was at he dentist I couldn't answer at the time. So my guess is that it only works if it's open, would be great if you could fix it.",08/05/20 20:25,4

My sincere thanks and gratitude for those generous volunteers for their patients, valuable time and help! T. Barr USA",01/07/16 20:58,3
Be My Eyes,"Fantastic idea and good implementation: there are way more volunteers than people who need to be helped, so you may not receive any calls.

Seeing AI,The short text reader is very quick and mostly accurate. Great for on the fly reading of bottles lotions and things like that. The document reader is very cool. You just hold it over the document and wait for it to take the picture as you were just. The other tabs did some work that’s why I only gave it a four star rating. It’s nice that when the document is processed it even keeps most of the formatting. KNFB reader does not do that. It just runs everything together. Very nice product. I wonder how long it will be free?,07/20/18 15:26,4

Seeing AI,"Hello I am blind and I use the Seeing AI app. It works. My only complaint is that we can’t wear a camera or and it is in progress to use the world setting for indoor use only at the moment it would make sense to me that person could make maybe glasses that you could wear with the success of the Seeing AI app in them or you could hold your phone up and it could describe the world around you, and if it could get good enough at this, you could walk around and be told some of how to get around you were still use your cane with the other hand, it also might be good if you had a FaceTime option and you had a live person that could come through and see what you’re looking at on the phone when your loan so they can describe things for you should be another good option for them to add and how come, they’re not helping the blind get those cars that I should do drive we’re supposed to be helping the disabled I approve of the Seeing AI app if you could get the cameras in glasses and have that app and maybe a FaceTime person person with ice blind could possibly navigate streets they would still want to pay attention with their cane",12/29/23 18:32,5

Supersense - AI for Blind,"This app includes the best scanner I have come across so far. It is very accurate, I would guess 99%. It is very easy to read mail very quickly if you put the scanner in document mode. The program will tell you how to move the phone so that it can get an accurate picture. It is wonderful, very easy to use, no errors where you get the left or right corners cut off or anything like that. The money reader is excellent. There are some experimental things, and I love the way they venture out to find new products. This is well worth the lifetime price that I paid. I am very happy with this product, and know that it will only get better as time passes.",05/01/23 3:55,5

For some reason, this app automatically logs me out all the time, and does not allow me to save my password.  So when I get a request for help, I have to log back in, and/or reset my password; and by the time I do that, someone else is already answering the call.

Be My Eyes,Download it now! The only excuse you can have is if you’re never on your phone. IF you’re always on your phone (which many of us are) it’s super easy to use and can help someone during a quick little painless video call. Spread it like wildfire.,03/26/18 16:44,5
Seeing AI,"This app used to be great, but it got much worse with the new “streamlined“ interface. The instant read function never worked well, but the handwriting channel was awesome. Combining those was a huge mistake. Once your app updates to the new version with the new integrated reading tool, you can’t go back to the good one. Hopefully they can fix the reading problem in the future.",02/22/25 6:01,2

Be My Eyes,"Most calls are very quick - I’ve helped people find a coffee cup on a table at an outdoor cafe, figure out which bathroom door they should use, find the right button on a microwave, check the size on baby clothes, and things like that.

Be My Eyes,"First off, I love the idea behind this app. After all, we’re all just humans living together on a planet, trying to help one another day by day. I just signed up for it yesterday and I received my first phone call today. Unfortunately, it was a group of people pranking me and laughing off camera. I am very disappointed in the app. I’m giving it one star for now because it was my first caller, but I will change it depending on whether I receive calls from people who truly need this service. I don’t know if there is a way to accurately screen the people who are signing up claiming to have a visual impairment versus a vile person just doing it for a laugh. I am hopeful this gets improved in the future.",08/29/20 20:42,1
Be My Eyes,I like the concept of this app but the only thing I’ve received from be my eyes is a bunch of junk mail. I haven’t received any actual assistance requests. Maybe there’s too many people signed up to help that it hasn’t cycled to me but 3 months seems ample time for that to happen.,04/19/20 11:50,2
Be My Eyes,The app and the concept is amaaaaazing In the first use. But their should be a feature to connect with those who could speak native plus English also do the we could also take their help to talk anyone in English.,05/19/22 3:17,5

TapTapSee,"I have never written a review before, but I have a strong urge to enhance this app for my Deafblind community, including myself. I do love the simplicity of its design and its grayish icon of an eye. I strongly suggest that it should have an accessible version for Deafblind (DB)— they would appreciate reading descriptions and converted text so that they won't feel inhibited in their access to visual information around them. Another suggestion is I don't know what limitations an iPhone 5 has, but it would be incredible to know the sound information around them, such as the ""inaudible"", ""music playing"", ""chatting"" and so on. Siri is able to recognize sounds and therefore, it should have a technology to detect sounds. In addition, it should include three different modes: Braille/Sizable text, Sound, and both that they can switch seamlessly. I will restore my 5 star rating when it's accessible for DB.  :'(",05/21/13 20:45,1
OneStep Reader,"Many reviews have already pointed out the unreliability of the importing feature. For me, it sometimes doesn’t show up unless I go away from the files tab and come back to it. The fact that I keep getting asked if I want to save my document after I’ve exported it makes  the process really slow. So for example, I will open a document, press save, pick a name, file type, and location, hit save, and then try to open another file, and I will get asked if I want to save the current document without closing. That seems unnecessary. I should be able to switch between files either with them auto saving or the app trusting that if I am moving away from the document I’ve finished with it.
The app also seems to be slow to respond to some button press. In previous versions it would also say how many pages out of the total document it’s converted which was useful to know.
Also, the app is still not integrated with iCloud. This is my main cloud service and I keep having to email myself documents I already have just so I can import them from my email.
Also, more of an iPad feature but it would be great to be able to use the app in landscape mode which is as of now unavailable..
Lastly, smart invert. I am someone who likes to look at the interface of my screen and use voiceover to read the elements. Now, smart invert, that is extremely useful in every other app on my phone, turns the interface to light. I realize the app is already set up for contrast, but I shouldn’t have to turn off smart invert to use KNFB and turn it on for the rest of my phone. The reader view is slightly different because I can customize the text color and background color, but the rest of the interface is extremely uncomfortable for me to look at. A simple fix would be to double contrast the whole app instead of just the camera so that the theme stays consistently dark with the rest of my apps.
The actual OCR capabilities of the app work well but the user experience is far from perfect. As a student in college that paid the full price of the app, I should have no issues with this app. But for now I am sorry to say it is not worth the price.",09/06/18 9:07,2

BlindSquare,"I am a certified orientation and mobility instructor in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. 
I used this app in my training programs for several years with good success. Unfortunately, the app is no longer working properly. I contacted the company. They appear to have fixed one bug with the most recent update, but other problems remain. BlindSquare could no longer recognize some familiar shops and cafes that are found on google and Apple Maps. Directional headings were variable and unreliable.",02/02/20 19:27,1

TapTapSee,"Take a photo, wait for 10-20 seconds and I gives a detailed accurate description of the scene e.g. A brown and black Yorkshire terrier. Copper coins in a mason jar. A MacBook Air.

The grammar describing the scene is poor when using English. The user interface is designed for those with poor vision so don't expect it to look impressive.",05/18/17 13:05,4

There is an issue when using it though. When active the phone heats a lot and the battery gets drained quite fast, 10 percent in les than 5 minutes.",07/21/17 7:12,4

Seeing AI,I don’t care at all for the recent update. I use Seeing AI mainly to OCR documents. I liked being able to read line by line and cut and paste various items. This function is now hidden under layers of AI which I don’t find nearly as useful.,02/19/25 13:26,3

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Terrible experience while I was unable to walk properly after having medication in my eyes. Lookout was constantly reading irrelevant texts in explore mode and making them up. Most of the time, object were detected on the sides rather than detecting obstacles while walking straight ahead.

Be My Eyes,Does not work for me because there aren't enough blind people lol.,04/02/22 12:23,5
Be My Eyes,Phenomenal concept. It's great to assist and be assisted without the burden of a long process or formality. Hoping many more visually impaired can be financially stable enough to be able to connect with the service in future or that it can become something offered for free by communications companies similar to how they offer social media only plans. 🍻 to the future,04/06/20 8:33,5
Be My Eyes,Best app of the year Like over 3million helpers. This restored my faith in humanity and I will be helping. It's amazing to see strangers help other strangers this is amazing and I wish play store puts this on the home page for it to grow bigger. Thank you,01/22/20 9:31,5

Envision AI,"The color detection is completely inaccurate, the scene detection could scare someone with often saying that there is a person/child there when there isn't, only the text recognition might be helpful for a visually impaired person. Another over priced technology for visually impaired people that claims a lot, but doesn't have much functionality. There are other Free apos that do these things better.They also have a pair of glasses that cost over 2k more than the tech they run off of.",03/05/21 21:49,2

Be My Eyes,"Great idea. Lousy execution. In the several years I've had the app installed, I've never ever received even a single call. The app is just sitting on my device wasting space. Edit 25/2/2024: My first review was in 2022. Now, 2 years later, still no messages or requests for help. If I need space, this app will be chopped if nothing changes soon.",02/25/24 15:05,1

Be My Eyes,"So, after almost 3 years of having this app on
my phone, I finally managed to be first to
accept a call and help someone. I was a little
disappointed when I first downloaded the app,
as nothing ever popped up while I was near my
phone. But I always kept it on my phone just in
case. I've seen a couple pop up over the last 3
years but never got them in time. Well... today,
it finally happened. I had a call pop up and I
quickly answered it. In all honesty it caught me
off guard, but I was excited and nervous all in
one, but I pressed that button as fast as I
could. It wasn't much. It was just someone
trying to do some grocery shopping, and needed help figuring out what one item was. It was just letting them know that they were holding a bag of chicken wings, that’s all, just a small menial task, not even taking a full minute out of my day. Not going to lie, It was kinda awkward, trying to direct them to have the phone positioned so I could see the item, but I can only imagine how difficult their lives are with literally EVERYTHING they do. It was a short call, but it felt so good being able to help out a total stranger all while gaining nothing from it. I have been looking forward to this day for so long, and now I’m just filled with excitement as I anticipate the next time I am able receive a call from this app!!

So in all seriousness, download this app!! It doesn’t require any special skills, no training, not even any time dedicated to checking the app. Just someone who likes helping out a total stranger in a time of need. There’s literally nothing to lose. 5 stars!!!",11/10/22 20:44,5

Seeing AI,I use this app every day and would not like to be without it.  I am always surprised with the speed of the short text facility.  Also I really like that it is able to make a good attempt with handwriting.  I am slightly disappointed with colour recognition though I am sure this will improve.  Can’t thank the developers enough.,02/27/18 7:17,5

From quick things like identifying colors, or locating a button all the way to helping someone stay safe and watch for cars on a 30 min walk. Sometimes calls are super quick and other people like to chat a bit which is so fun! I love that this resource exists and that there are so many helpers, making it easy for the vision impaired to get help quickly and conveniently as they move through their day.",12/12/22 0:06,5

Be My Eyes,"Fantastic idea from a fantastic person I love the concept of this completely free and very useful app. As a volunteer, I simply receive an alert that someone needs some assistance. The call will go to several volunteers. If you are the first to answer, then you can help. It may be something like which carton is the almond milk. It is so nice to do something for someone else, even in a very small way.",03/26/23 3:44,5

OneStep Reader,"I bought this app when it first came out years ago, and it was about the only one on the market. I have used it, tried to use it, got so frustrated I quit using it, and I found that there are other apps out there, much cheaper or free that do as good or better job than this app. I would love to get my money back, but haven’t owned it since the very beginning. I’m sure that’s not a possibility. I do not recommend this app for anyone, low vision, no vision voiceover, user, etc.
Usually you get what you pay for with an app however, in this case you don’t!",07/19/23 11:24,1
Be My Eyes,"I have had the app for over a year and had never received a call. I totally forgot about it, honestly, until I received my first call today! I was so excited.

Be My Eyes,"Doesn't allow you to answer from locked phone (Moto g7), unlike normal calls. I've missed 3 calls in the year that I've had this installed, simply because nothing at all shows on screen, just my usual black locked screen, despite ringing.

Be My Eyes,I want to give it 4 stars just because they are helping others who are blind and are trying to make thier life much more easier.

Be My Eyes,"If you believe that making the world a better place is good, please do, in any way you can.  This app helps to do so.  You can do something as simple as helping a nearsighted or blind friend put laundry soap instead of fabric softener in a washer. Or choose the correct medication or music playlist.  It essentially shows the helper live video asking for help with a task; Which button on the remote is Input? Is this is blue or green? Is this a cigarette lighter or a flash drive?  bemyeyes is good. please support it.",11/29/17 23:49,5

I started messing around with the app when i figured it out and it’s insane how helpful this app is!  If i knew anyone that was vision impaired i would recommend this, though since i am not vision impaired (outside of having to wear glasses) i cant say it’s perfect because i don’t know for certain. It does make me happy though, it’s like a metal detector for colors, people, objects, and scenes which is probably super useful for the vision impaired!",01/31/21 19:12,5

Be My Eyes,You don’t realize the minute you get the call who’s gonna change the day you or the caller. I have cried after hanging up so many times. From the LOVE that is truly shared with each call!  I wish they’d call more!!! 💕💯,02/21/21 22:04,5
Be My Eyes,"I've had the app for quite awhile now and love when I get a notification that someone needs assistance. While there aren't a lot of requests for assistance, knowing that I can help at least one person is better than nothing. I wish more individuals with a sight impairment knew about this awesome resource.",06/04/17 19:39,5
Be My Eyes,An amazing app that lets sighted people help visually impaired people do the things we take for granted. I've only received one call but it was a great feeling to be able to help her get the right frozen meal out of the freezer area. Do it! Get the app!,08/15/21 11:42,5
Seeing AI,I love this Ap! I live by myself. And it helps me out so much! Like with my mail something you might not want it to be seen by a lot of people. For one reason or another. And loving the bar code reader as well. I could go on! I could be a spokes person for it. Helps me be more independent! And that  means a lot!,07/16/19 20:19,5

Seeing AI,"I was excited to see the introduction of the app particularly for a family member. However it needs a bit of work. I found the app to be buggy. Specifically, each of the channels did not begin translation immediately. In fact, I had to re-launch the app multiple times before automatic translation would begin on the each channel. Also the app crashed several times in my less than one day of use.",07/13/17 16:15,2
Be My Eyes,I loved the idea so much ❤️❤️❤️,03/21/20 3:06,5
Be My Eyes,"Very happy I got a call today, although the signal wasn’t great I was very happy I could help out and can’t wait for my next 1, today I had to read a couple of pages from a psychology book!! The signal made it hard to read but I tried my best, was told that taking a screenshot and reading it from my photos was the best way and it was, very polite and patient woman on the other end 😊",03/25/23 10:28,5
Be My Eyes,This is such a neat way to be able to help people. I am so excited whenever someone uses this to ask for help. It’s a great way to give back. I have a daughter who is visually impaired and I am thrilled to be part of this.,01/11/21 1:55,5
Envision AI,dear developers envission application lifetime subscription is too much price! so kindly reduce your price below 2000. otherwise we will avoid your application permanently. are we will approach our cracking team. I wish will the price reduced soon thank you.,04/09/19 1:41,5
Be My Eyes,"Urgent Requirement: 1. The video quality and zooming features need to improve a lot for beter help to blind users. If the user needs help with reading or identifying something which is why 99% of the calls are made, volunteers can only help when the video is good enough. If it's a blurry video, its a waste of time and leads to frustration for the user 2. Also, the calls don't get connected to earphones. not possible to take the calls on speaker all the time Hope the team will improve on these.",04/02/25 1:09,1
Be My Eyes,I am happy to give so little to a person who need a helping app.,05/12/19 17:03,5

Be My Eyes,Amazing! Just helped someone with cooking instructions.,11/16/21 10:30,5
Be My Eyes,"I love that there is an app that allows me to offer help to those who are visually impaired. However, the feedback and the ""problems"" button at the end of a call do not work so I can not provide feedback when I've had any issues. I had to resort to posting this in hopes the creators/maintainers see this and can help fix it. Other than this, the appa is amazing. The only other thing that could make it more amazing is if they tracked the calls I've taken, but that's an ""if you can"" ask.",07/17/22 0:35,3
Be My Eyes,So glad someone came up with this app. I really love when a call pops up bc I've had so many kind interactions and it's a good boost of serotonin to help strangers in need.,02/25/24 15:02,5
Be My Eyes,"I hope more apps like this would be cretaed to help people who have disadvantages in life! Besides, ony forst call, i met a person who needs help on a medicine's direction. As the image is a bit blurry ( i dont know if it was because my wifi or because of the app) i cant see the direction and decided to go to google to find that brand. As i head to google, i cant get back to the call and he cant hear me so he has to ended the call. I feel so sad and guilty. I'm so sorry Mr. Stranger :(",04/28/21 17:45,5

Be My Eyes,Just had my first call since downloading the app nearly a year ago. A gentleman in Alberta Canada had lost his wallet in his house. So lovely to be able to help in some small way. It was only after I thought that maybe some people may make the call because they are lonely or sad and wouldn’t it be nice if you could keep in touch with some of the people you’ve helped. Just a thought.,05/23/19 15:08,5
Be My Eyes,I love helping people and this app does exactly that. You help people in a most incredible way by helping them see what they can’t.,11/12/20 6:26,5

Be My Eyes,"Nothing short of an example of a need being met. The app is clean running 
and non invasive in any way. The only notification I get are the ones that

hope to get more calls to help.",06/12/18 16:35,5

Be My Eyes,"I am so glad this service exists, and have been anxiously awaiting my first call. When it rang, I clicked the button to connect but it would never connect.

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,Super app. Amazing app. Helpful for bling and low vision. Railway stations announcement must be bit accurate when the train arrives.,07/26/22 4:21,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is truly inspirational. As a volunteer I was hesitant at first to install. I thought I would surely have to pay for something so great. Or it would take me through a hefty process that I somehow wouldn't qualify for. But thats definitely not the case. Its so so so easy. It took me less than five minutes to get situated in the app and now I just leave it logged in and go about my day. The only thing is since theres so many volunteers, it could take a while before I get my first call, which isn't a big deal. 
This is amazing, and it makes me happy that there are people in this world willing to help others.",07/03/19 17:02,5

TapTapSee,"This is a great app. Identified everything I pointed it at. 

Pity the IDIOT that called it bull rap does not have the brain capacity to understand that it does not have to be all bells and whistles. 

The majority of the people using it have limited or no visibility.

No buttons or text is needed.

Kudos to the developers.  Now if only Google Goggles would be as accurate.  Don't know how you do it, but keep up the good work guys.",09/23/13 1:25,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,Super it is an old kind of version,06/22/22 8:18,5
Envision AI,"First, thanks to the developers of envision AI for staying so engaged with the user community and constantly making the app better. It is really a valuable tool! My favorite thing about this app is the document scanner. It is by far the most accurate OCR I’ve ever experienced on my iPhone. A couple years ago I purchased something called KNFB reader which if I recall was like $100 and it cannot compete with envision OCR. The instant text feature can be very useful but I feel it also has room for further development. It continuously re-scans what you are aiming it at, sometimes resulting in garbled output, and it constantly cuts off and interrupts its own output even if you barely move your phone. It’s really a game of seeing if you can make out what it says well enough to at least accomplish the task. For example, if I aim it at a carton that I pull out of the fridge and I hear something that sounds similar to “milk” or “half-and-half,” I know what I’ve just grabbed, but I really think it could work a lot more smoothly. I have a suggestion – somehow combine the object recognition and instant text technologies such that the instant text reader has some awareness of what you are pointing it at. In my milk carton example, it would know that it’s reading within the bounds of that object which might help it focus. Along similar lines, I have a heck of a time getting it to read LCD screens on home appliances and electronics. I wish there was a way you could tell it to recognize an LCD screen and have it only focus on text that appears on that screen. This is a suggestion I made a while back and it hasn’t been implemented yet, but I can’t imagine others wouldn’t find it helpful. Giving it five stars because overall I still think it’s outstanding, but I hope to see it continue to improve. Thank you",07/30/22 15:01,5

If you have full vision, please consider being a volunteer. Help us read bottles, match clothes, find that special outfit for a night out… you never know what you might be asked to help with.

I use the app frequently to identify canned foods, and the short text feature was great for this. It would immediately start reading the cans. Now it takes me a couple minutes just to get it to read anything useful from the can to know what it is. Having an iPhone 14 Pro camera makes no difference from when I had a 12 Mini. One would think a better camera would help. Recent app updates hasn't improved anything for me either. Now I mostly use it for light detection to turn lights off at night.

Be My Eyes,Just joined. Recommended by my lovely friend who loves to help people. Look forward to helping through this app 🙂,05/04/22 14:26,5
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,"Cool app. I was shown this by my mobility officer, however, this app doesn't work so well over mobile data. It just announces that my location is inaccurate. This could be more usefulness if it just worked over mobile data without pining for WiFi all the time.",10/31/23 16:57,3
Be My Eyes,I had an awesome experience i had just gotten my first call ans it made me super happy that i can do something to help in the world,06/28/22 21:18,5
Vision- for blind people,"The app is not very accurate in describing colors. The light brown table (a little darker than light tan) was considered orange, my magenta shorts were considered dark pink when magenta is a dark pink/purple color, my dark brown couch was black.

My legs were considered a part of another person, I was laying down on the couch.

The tv remote was considered on my left when it was on my right.

They make you pay before being able to use the app, I wish they would have chosen a 14 day trial option.

The accuracies were if I was too close to the stairs and couldn’t see them well, or if an object  was in my way, I just wish you didn’t have to take pictures all the time to be able to get this information.",09/17/22 16:11,2
Be My Eyes,I really like using this app. I would not uninstall this app frvr,03/20/22 2:09,5
Envision AI,perfect recognition and it is a best app for visually impaired,12/19/22 16:36,5
WeWALK - Smart Map,each and every option should be available at least four 2 days trial! I saw some videos regarding Assistant GPT with Real-Time capabilities,04/04/25 2:00,1
Be My Eyes,It takes 2 minutes of your time to be kind. High recommend this app. I received my first call the day after downloading the app.,01/08/20 2:10,5
Be My Eyes,"Unless you’re actively using your phone, you won’t be able to answer before another user. I’ve had 5 calls in 2.5 years and have missed 3 of them, despite having my phone in my hands when I was notified someone was calling.",12/26/22 14:52,5
TapTapSee,This app increases the independence of those who are blind and visually impaired because it decreases the dependence on their side it appears to obtain information and identification of objects in the use of this app keep up the good work it's awesome and wonderful thank you,03/09/13 17:38,5
Be My Eyes,"After using the app more the call and video quality is very bad and frustrating. This is the case on both wifi and cellular. I'm going to uninstall it because I feel like I cause more harm than good. If it improves, I'd reconsider installing it again.",01/14/22 14:23,1
Be My Eyes,"I read about Be My Eyes in an article one day early into the pandemic. I installed the app in 2020 and have since answered 15 or so calls.  

I like the ux design, it’s no bells and whistles and works reliably. I’ve never been dropped from a call and the camera works reliably enough for me to read small text. 

Every one of the calls I’ve answered has been with kind people. I happily drop whatever I’m doing to answer when I see a call come through because there’s an uplifting sense of usefulness when a call comes in and you can help someone simply by having vision and being willing to share it for a couple of minutes. That to me is the beauty of technology. I’d love to see more apps like this one.",08/08/22 4:23,5
Be My Eyes,I have had the app for a really long time. I have only received one call and about a computer issue where computers aren’t really my thing. I was sad,07/31/18 6:32,1
Be My Eyes,So beautiful to see people to put aside their differences and help one another like this,01/28/20 12:50,5
Be My Eyes,Love this app and love that you can form a community and help others at any time.,01/23/20 18:14,5
TapTapSee,I wish that it would read it to you,03/09/21 11:56,5
Be My Eyes,"Amazing technology I really loved helping someone else. It made me feel great to tell her what present arrived for her dog , her dog was very happy to and very cute",12/05/18 22:29,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing concept. Love it.,12/25/17 8:14,5
Be My Eyes,The app it's self is a great concept but how to functions isnt. You don't get calls if you were one of the first people to get it & you can't log in to an existing account. Love the concept just hate how it works #deleted,02/22/15 16:52,2
Envision AI,further improvement will help to enhance this app it's beautiful but some feasibility is missing taking much time to speak out and find out the objects and some other features will added it's better thank you,04/20/22 8:54,5
Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer for be my eyes and it always makes me so happy to answer calls and even just chat and have convos with the people on here!,12/01/24 22:08,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is nothing short of amazing. I'm a volunteer and just got my first 
call. It totally made my day! What a great way for me to help others who 
need help. And it's so easy. Way to go BE MY EYES, you are the best app 
EVER!!!",06/16/18 7:13,5
Be My Eyes,It happen i got a call three time..But the screen was black..n i cannot hear the audio at all... it so sad i cannot help them when they need my help.,07/22/20 19:04,3

Be My Eyes,Magnificent app and it helps me move forward,06/01/21 21:37,4
Be My Eyes,Just got my first call to see if the persons battery back would charge to 100% it is! So happy to help! 🫂🌈🥰,08/18/24 10:18,5
Be My Eyes,"Great concept. You don't get called often (I didn't get my first call until three weeks after I installed it). When I did, I was away from home on T-Mobile LTE network. It worked perfect. The video quality was really good. I was able to help someone identify the sender of a package he received in the mail.",05/14/15 13:15,5
Be My Eyes,"After having this app for a few years and missing calls by a few seconds, I finally had my first call and it was an amazing experience to help someone who needed me. Even though I was a bit nervous, it went incredibly well and my caller was so thankful. Yet, it was a humbling experience and afterwards I had a lump in my throat and needed a few minutes to compose myself. To help a stranger was well worth the wait. Please if you’re on the fence, take the leap to use this app to help another who needs your eyes. It is so worth it!",11/14/20 23:37,5
Be My Eyes,I just answered my first call and it was just not helpful. The poor camera quality was frustrating to the point where I couldn't read what the caller wanted me to so they ended the call. I also tried submitting a thumbs down after the call and was not able to press it. I have unistalled the app since it seems others have the same issue yet the developers haven't tried improving the app. Highly disappointed that an app meant to help isn't actively trying.,03/30/23 7:16,1
Be My Eyes,Call wasn't connecting .... please look into this .... 🙏🏻 😭 😢 I felt sad not being able to help someone who was in need,01/08/22 22:12,1
Be My Eyes,I'm bilingual and I could help more people than only the ones that speak the language I selected. It would be better to be able to select more languages than just one.,08/11/21 3:51,4
Be My Eyes,Help someone who is visually impaired.,09/26/18 8:00,5
Be My Eyes,This app is so amazing and selfless. I love answering and helping ppl do everyday things. It’s very humbling and such a good deed. Thanks to the creators of this app!,02/11/21 14:14,5
Be My Eyes,hopefully it will have import and share photos in different applications in android users.,01/01/24 23:18,3
OneStep Reader,"I bought it, used it, and love it.  Talk about a product that is simply amazing.  It's everything it was promised to be.",09/19/14 11:54,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"Great app. I'm not visually impaired, just tried this if it works. There are times it won't recognize the object in front, like the door or a bureau",10/23/20 0:09,3

Be My Eyes,"Seriously, the absolute BEST app ever made. So worth it 💯",03/12/24 5:06,5
Be My Eyes,I never receive calls and i feel like at this point this app is just holding up space in my phone and it’s crazy because I want to help someone I want to use my eyes to help other people but this app I don’t like it I never received call,05/03/22 22:46,1
Be My Eyes,it would be helpful if I could get some support live on the phone to better navigate. I'm still in the dark...,04/30/23 11:01,2
Be My Eyes,"For those that haven't noticed yet, blind and visually impaired people are more and more able to use smartphones or tablets through features like apple's voice over. So it makes sense having this kind of app. My friend that is blind is very used to her Ipad despite being blind and says this app is of great help for her. Now very welcome to android",10/06/17 15:57,5
Loadstone GPS,Great job when you came out with us last year and better job with the updates keep up the good work,07/23/18 19:33,5

Be My Eyes,what a wonderfully easy way to give something back,02/13/19 13:22,5
Seeing AI,"I appreciate your valuable app for blind people. Many users outside the US need it. as they requested me write it for you Please apply these suggestions below 1 removing restrictions and Allowing installation in all countries, especially Afghanistan. 2 Adding Persian language for users in Iran and Afghanistan because they don'tknow English properly. 2 Supporting Afghan currency for users in Afghanistan to identify their cash. notes I hope to see these changes soon. regards",01/12/24 10:39,5
Seeing AI,I use this app daily to get around and interpret my surroundings.  It’s the biggest reason I’ve stuck with iPhones because it’s exclusive to iPhone.,03/17/20 19:16,5

Be My Eyes,Such a good idea!!!!!,07/04/19 15:06,5
TapTapSee,"What is going on sometimes I can use this app and it works just fine other times I put things in front of it, and it tells me something out rages, and this is horrible, I appreciate they are trying to make an app to help the blind, but some of the results seems like they are trying to trick the blind",02/23/19 13:02,1
Seeing AI,"I see so many possibilities for this app. It’s very user friendly. My 5 year old nephew loved the People part and was taking pictures of everyone! When showing it to colleagues, they immediately planned on installing it for their elderly parents. Office Lens is a little more accurate for full document reading, but the short text works great! I often recommend it and use it myself, even though I’m not visually impaired. The development team is amazing and responsive to feedback. Way to go!",01/30/18 0:15,5
Be My Eyes,I like this application,04/22/20 11:23,5
Seeing AI,"I was suspicious of this app, especially given its early release in its lifecycle.  I can definitely say that it impressed me in very short order with its capacity to visually recognize a myriad of scenarios and make very accurate statements based on what is seen. 
It conjures up what hot dog/not hot dog from Silicon Valley should have been.",07/13/17 6:11,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Oh my god very amazing and accessible useful application for visually impaired community in the world I request to the Google team please include Nepali and other language and Nepali currency identify on this Google lookout and when we use explore mode it give us slow feedback on our Android improve this issue also and include Nepali country in the food mode also on this app and give update fast thanks,01/26/22 0:43,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this app so much I love helping others and volunteering in my community. This app is nothing short of volunteering & helping out not just the permanently blind, but temporarily blind, and people who are experiencing vision loss either in one or both eyes….but will eventually lead to permanent vision loss.
   I also have helped some people who are extremely dyslexic, which thank God my mother experiences, extreme cases of dyslexia, and also people who are colorblind, (I didn’t even think to what extent color blindness can  affect’s one’s entire vision in the long run). I’ve never had a problem when it comes to anybody being disrespectful or coming off creepy or anything of the sort. I’ve been very lucky to answer calls for people who are very much in need, and are very grateful, very helpful throughout the process and are just amazing people. Thank you for making this up. It does help me as much as it helps. Other people who cannot get around on a day-to-day basis due to a disability and I hope to continue to help and speak with others as often as the calls come in. ❤️",10/04/22 4:00,5
Be My Eyes,"There needs to be more guidance apps like this to help disabled people. If you're visually impaired, there are people ready to help. In my opinion people should be vetted before volunteering just to prevent abuse. But that's my only concern. For those not getting any calls, it took me 3 months, its normal as theres millions of helpers and only hundreds of thousands impaired people",08/21/19 17:42,4
Be My Eyes,This is a great app. Very easy to use and so rewarding for both the volunteer and the blind person needing a little help. Just takes a quick moment to use. Only downside is that there are not enough calls and they are hard to get. This is due to difference in # of volunteers and blind people. We need to encourage more people to sign up!,12/31/21 2:17,5

Seeing AI,"so the app is great but the find my things feature is kind of broken for me. So I set it up with my water bottle, and tested it to see how it worked, so I clicked on what I named it and it closed the app. I tried a second time, and the same thing happened. It’s be great if that issue is looked into. Great app!",04/10/24 13:52,4

Seeing AI,Microsoft rocking it again!,08/08/17 8:06,5
Be My Eyes,Haven’t received a single call. It’s been almost a month. They allow anyone to be a volunteer but there are not enough users on the app who require its services. So you waste space with an app and eventually forget you even have it. Was looking forward to helping others. Now it’s just cluttering my phone.,07/25/19 17:24,1
Be My Eyes,Such a simple but incredibly powerful concept. Something so easy that takes up 30 seconds of your time can help others.,06/02/20 2:04,5

God bless you all 
True human 
Thank you",08/17/22 23:09,5
Be My Eyes,I was more than happy to read her the labels that she was interested knowing about so when it came time for her to start cooking she wouldn’t have any problems to start cooking and everything should go very smoothly. I wished her the best of luck and we both ended the call. Oh I hope and wish her the very best of luck with making her recipe. I would really love to see all of this go very smoothly and taste delicious for the whole family but especially for her who is putting so much effort into making this wonderful meal for her and her family. I hope they appreciate it very much. That’s my review for this one call. Thank you so much for the opportunity to allow me to help these people. It’s such a blessing for me to pay it forward in anyway possible. Carrie Williams,04/13/24 19:22,5

TapTapSee,In the past I got fairly accurate results reading temperatures on my thermostat and also my weight on a scale. I was recently informed that it gave really really bad results for another person using it for temperatures on a thermostat so I tried it myself. It told me that my thermostat was a PS3 with a controller and then it told me my thermostat was an area rug.These were the same types of descriptions given to the other person using it to read temperatures.,01/15/19 19:13,1

Seeing AI,"When I use the app i don’t think when I go into the camera it supposed say (my name) near right edge. It’s really creepy because I never gave it my name and it just knows my name when I go into the camera? And I have tried it on my friends and it doesn’t say any names it only says my name when I go into the camera. Please tell me that it doesn’t know what I look like and it doesn’t know my name because it is scarring me.

Be My Eyes,As long as you have good service this app works great. I won’t answer unless I do because it will really make it hard and I don’t want the person asking for help to get frustrated. Besides that it feels great to be able to help no matter how big or small the task is.,12/14/20 16:18,5
Be My Eyes,"What an amazing use of technology to actually improve the lives of real people. I’ve been on  the “volunteer” side for six years, and have been able to help people all over the world with things I take for granted every day. Everyone I’ve helped has been so kind and thankful.

Be My Eyes,I cannot tell you how excited I got just now when my phone rang to help someone after downloading the app around six months ago. It was a lady who got some beauty items from a food pantry. 💗,12/20/19 2:29,5
Envision AI,This has been my go-to app the last few weeks because of its accuracy in reading text. I prefer this over seeing ai but that works only for folks who want use this the app in English. Envision AI works in German too which is my 2nd language. I love that the developers are taking the effort to do this! Worth the subscription!,02/10/18 9:41,5

Be My Eyes,It's been 6 months since I've been a part of Be My Eyes app network!! I got first call after 15 days of signing up as a volunteer and I still remember it was to help a person with some documents! I felt so good after that! And we are still in touch. Now if that person needs any help with the documents and text reading they directly connect with me. This app is really helpful for visually impaired people who need help with daily tasks. Thanks Be My Eyes!! You are doing an amazing job!!,07/18/22 9:51,5

Seeing AI,"Hello:

I am a totally blind person who thoroughly enjoys using the Seeing AI app. Just a quick note to let you know that I absolutely love the Seeing AI app. I absolutely love it's many features, and it is truly a life-changing app. I use the short text feature when I want to find out who may have sent me mail, or if I want to find out something about a flyer or something like that. I also really enjoy using the product feature where I can read information about everything from bags of skittles to chips and other things such as canned goods. Your app as all the other readers of it's type completely beaten. Once again, I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work. I'm a fan for life.",08/15/17 0:56,5
Be My Eyes,May allah bless you,09/25/24 5:20,5
Envision AI,"The Envision app is definately by far the best app for the blind and visually impaired on the market today. It far surpasses all of the other apps for android due to the fact that it is so easy to use, and gives you auditory guidance when lining up the text for reading and so on. As a user of the app myself, I have come to realize just how useful it can really be in so many situations. At the time of this writing, I am on the free trial version of the app, but I can definitely tell you that this app will bring a level of independence that no other app on the market can bring you. For one thing, the accuracy of the scanning of the text is far superior than any other app. The folks at Envision have really thought of everything! Being blind or visually impaired doesn't have to be a prison any longer. Technology has come to the rescue with Envision, a brand new innovation in wearable and handheld technology that uses artificial intelligence to help the blind and visually impaired to navigate in a sighted world. Now for the first time in history, artificial intelligence is able to help the blind and visually impaired get more information from a sighted world by implementing the reading of text based information in real time, or by taking photos and relaying the information through optical character recognition technology that is second to none in the industry. Not only this, but Envision technology can do so much more. You can use it to describe your surroundings, tell you what color something is, identify faces and even read bar codes and identify certain objects. This means that Envision AI technology can actually learn thus making it the one and only technology for the blind and visually impaired that is fully customizable for each person's individual needs. You see, more and more companies are jumping onto the bandwagon by creating their own wearables and such that are designed to improve the lives of those who are sight impaired. However, Envision is the only company that takes it all a step further and really goes out of the way to research and implement new innovative technologies that other companies can only dream about adding to their products. This is because the people behind Envision are serious about their work, and they want to provide a product that not only works, but actually enriches the lives of the blind and visually impaired all around the world. So whether you have the app installed onto your phone, or you're using the new Envision glasses, you're sure to get as much information as possible about your surroundings and other things that you need on a daily basis that will help you work,learn or play. Envision's optical character recognition is far superior than many other apps and devices on the market today. You can read books, magazines and any text on any surface, even from television screens, computer screens and other digital displays. Envision is the only technology that encorporates real-time reading of text so that if you need to read house numbers, signs or anything else immediately, Envision AI can definitely handle it for you with no problem whatsoever. No other device or app can do this. So whether you're in school, working on the job, or whatever, Envision AI can do what you need it to do throughout your entire day without getting tired or giving up on you. You are able to read any printed text, and even some hand written text as well. The goal of Envision is to make blind or visually impaired people as independent as humanly possible without needing any assistance from a real human, but even if that's needed, you can still get human guidance because you can call someone and they're connected directly into the app, or into the glasses and they're seeing exactly what you see, so they can guid you around objects and such. Here again, no other device on the market can even do this. Envision AI is the only product that can provide this to the user. So as you can see, Envision AI is definitely hands down the winner here. It does far more than any other vision system on the market today.",11/09/21 0:01,5

BlindSquare,"This app continues to be the best blind GPS app for iOS. It seriously keeps getting better. My only criticism is the organization is too compacted, and can be fairly confusing to new converts. I hear this has already been taken to heart and will be fixed in later releases. Still, an absolute must have for those with a visual disability.",03/18/14 4:39,5

Sorry, but I can’t. Please update.",05/15/20 10:47,1

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I originally downloaded this app before it was a monthly or yearly subscription. Like others I find it disappointing that it is now subscription based for something that was free.  I also find it frustrating to use as it doesn’t lock the camera on the walk sign and as you walk it loses what it sees from natural normal movements. It also seems inconsistent at lights. I’ve crossed a couple lights 2 it handled as best as it could considering the previously stated locking issues, then I crossed at a major intersection and it completely failed and didn’t notify me when I could walk at all it just went silent. Thankfully I had other support but for something I am paying to use this should not be an issue what so ever. The inconsistencies are concerning at best.",02/09/25 21:59,3

Get the price down.  Please",04/14/15 11:44,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"In a world where many apps try to be all things to all people, OKOh is delightfully simple. It does what it says it does. It accurately and quickly identifies the state of traffic lights. In my experience, it was able to do this from a great distance, which can often be helpful when you are approaching an intersection.

I am very picky when it comes to my apps, and I am usually very quickly disappointed by the trendy and new. In this case, though, I was delighted by my first experience with OKO and it has now become a permanent fixture in my travel toolbox. Great work!",05/03/24 12:51,5

TapTapSee,"This app is very helpful. I have used it to identify food items, American currency, color of clothing, and pictures in  my photo library. Though I can't always know what the picture is because of the description, it is still helpful to know what they are  even in  a general way. I  also  took pictures of some remodeling  that was done in my kitchen, and they turned out well. I did ask someone before sending, just wanted to make sure.  i also took a few shots for Facebook of my animals. One time, I just got the description white fur.  which was one of my cats. So, guess it didn't take it that well. Probably user error. After trying several times, I was able to get a picture . Keep up the good work. .",07/27/13 23:18,5

Envision AI,Many many thanks it's made us able to see. God bless you.,09/03/18 4:42,5
Be My Eyes,I received my first call today. It was so cool that I could help someone. One thing that would be cool is if there was a log in your profile that tells you how many people you helped and where they are from. That would be super neat. But otherwise love that a simple task such as this can help someone else in a huge way.,12/20/22 22:36,5

Be My Eyes,My only question/issue is that when someone calls I have to swipe and press etc. on my iPhone and it never picks up quick enough. Y'all need to incorporate a fast answer/insta-connect option so the sighted volunteers and chose that option to immediately answer a call. If that's possible.,07/11/19 21:30,5

He could hear me so I read him all I could see then said maybe he would like to call back for a clearer connection I wasn't sure but I did all I could with what I had.

Be My Eyes,Please add a way for the caller to share their location. I received a call from lady who was lost in a parking lot in pitch black darkness. I couldn't be of any use to her. There also needs to be a way for us to notify emergency services if the person with impaired vision requires assistance of that nature.,05/01/24 2:20,5
Be My Eyes,"I signed up July of 2019 and have helped at least 10 people so far. (May 2024) It seems the more you engage with the app, the more likely you are to get calls. It's a great feeling!",05/24/24 19:52,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,I especially like that all of the controls work seamlessly with voiceover. This app was clearly designed by people who know how to interact with the visually impaired community. Good work.,01/18/21 7:03,5
Be My Eyes,What an amazing app to help people keep as much independence as possible in their daily lives ♥️,02/02/23 11:40,5
Be My Eyes,Charging blind people for the app then getting people with vision to work for them for free by making them think they are helping. All blind people using the app have to pay.,01/24/20 8:16,1
Be My Eyes,wow easy to use and help people. simple app to make a difference,02/06/19 20:45,5
TapTapSee,"I think this is the best picture app ever! This app definitely does help a sight impaired person. I have done experimentations in my room, and it let me know what is around me as I pointed the camera at a specific location as voiceover reads the description when the picture is processed.

I am partially sight impaired myself, and this is an excellent way to either read menus or science, or just identify surroundings. I will give it more than five stars!",06/05/16 19:45,5
Be My Eyes,Seems like a good idea but just wondering if anyone actually uses it? Had it for about 6 months now and haven’t been contacted for help by anybody.,07/20/18 6:21,5
Be My Eyes,"A great idea, but poor follow up. I have had this app for over a year now, I have received total of 2 calls. It is a shame that there is such an imbalance between the number of volunteers and visually impaired people. This app could change the world for a lot of people from especially less developed countries, including my own. I find it difficult to understand how the same people who had the idea to create such an amazing app, does absolutely nothing to improve their app and awareness... SHAME",10/14/20 10:35,4
Be My Eyes,"I have only been able to answer a few calls since I have had this application, but feel blessed to be able to help. I like the way that the application lets the blind person use their cellphone camera to show me what they need help understanding and how it enables us to talk.",08/13/19 2:23,5
Be My Eyes,This is a great app. It feels great to assist someone and it cost nothing to do so.,03/06/23 4:42,5

Be My Eyes,"There should be more apps/ things available to help people from our community’s. We’re all human, we all should bond together and progress. I believe with this app we have a start!",10/15/19 17:42,5
Envision AI,"So I always wanted an app where I didn’t have to read my documents and where I could just leave them with the voice doing it, but now we have the opportunity to do that because of this good app",12/04/21 22:07,5
Be My Eyes,Nothing is working :/,01/21/20 17:22,1
Be My Eyes,This application helps the blind to be able to find stuff by themselves. For example you can make a call and ask someone to help you find a pill bottle that you miss placed. Or also if you dropped something and cannot find it you can call a volunteer and have them help you find some thing you've dropped as well. There are many different things you can use the application for. And the bee my ice team continues to make great strides every day for the application to work and be accessible for those of us who are blind or visually impaired. thank you be my ice team for the great work that you do in making this application accessible for those who are blind or visually impaired. Keep up the great work.,08/24/23 10:56,5

Seeing AI,I love this Ap! I live by myself. And it helps me out so much! Like with my mail something you might not want it to be seen by a lot of people. For one reason or another. And loving the bar code reader as well. I could go on! I could be a spokes person for it. Helps me be more independent! And that  means a lot!,07/16/19 13:19,5
Seeing AI,"I really love this app.I am hopeful that the features available when using this app on iPhone, which are not currently available on Android, such as: Indore navigation, world, will also be available on Android soon.

Seeing AI,I am a completely blind user of this app. I love the app 😊 I use it with voice over the screen mirror on Apple products with my iPhone. The only problem that I am seeing is it does not do a good job when you try to use it with those 2 L bottles of pop that people get Voice is not reading me any of the information the camera isn’t working and whether I use the short text or document mode it doesn’t work and doesn’t help and also voiceover is having trouble. It doesn’t say hold steady every time to know the cameras in the right place and lined up it’s not telling me every single time I think it’s a bug please fix all this if you can and add another mood for reading labels on 2 L bottles of pop. Thank you.,01/31/24 12:35,4
Be My Eyes,"This idea is awesome. I think an app like this could be made for other 
disabilities and the elderly. Like if a lawn needed to be mowed or help 
putting away groceries, etc..",06/24/18 12:03,5
Be My Eyes,"This is a great app.  It works very well based on my participation.  You’re not going to get a lot of calls because of the sheer number of participants but when you do it is a wonderful feeling.  In the 6 years I’ve done this, I’ve gotten 5-10 calls. Is it worth it?  Definitely!",08/09/22 4:33,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is life changing. It makes life so much easier to have a sighted person’s assistance at the tap of a button. I’m an independent person, but there are those times when sighted assistance is necessary. To have this available within moments is so wonderful. 

I’m a vision teacher and show this to all of my students. Students have cried at the freedom this app has given them.",03/12/18 19:18,5
Seeing AI,"I truly love this iPhone application As someone who is completely blind. I have only one thing that could make this app better. Please add a PDF conversion channel. I cannot even say how many times I receive digital documents from professors and others in my college experience.

Be My Eyes,"As volunteers who want to help and users who need help, people should be sharing this app like gossip at a church picnic. With so many volunteers, just about every informational resource available to visually impaired people should include this app. The ratio of volunteers/users is so immense, getting an actual call to action once a year is understandable. I'm going to be in a bit of self denial about the Data-Mining reviews, I'm hoping the trackers are to enhance connectivity.",09/03/20 17:34,5

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,It is really an awesome application for visually impaired. My best wishes are always with developer team. Because of your application I don't have to be dependent on others. I can find everything I wish around me without asking anyone. I really proud of you for your efforts. I wish you to add more features to make blind people more independent. God bless.,11/28/22 6:54,5
Be My Eyes,"Earlier today I got my first call.  I am so glad this app is there to help people who may not always have someone around, I hope this app gets spread to more people who need it and I’m so glad that the people on it are so nice, I was a little sceptical about the idea of this at first but then as I use it and as I help people with the little things I understand why they would make this, the man I helped today was absolutely so sweet and kind and he was just asking me to help him figure out what some of his groceries were and it was an honor, I helped him sort his coffee and mashed potatoes, and you should’ve heard his voice when I told him he had picked up his cottage cheese, he was so happy and I realize it’s the little things in life we take for granted, download this app, you won’t regret it.",02/07/21 6:39,5

Be My Eyes,"Great idea, thank you",10/12/19 13:53,5
Be My Eyes,Only issue I have and it may be my mobile data is when I'm out and the video won't load. Other than that great app,12/23/21 15:45,4
Be My Eyes,Amazing cool app that helps people all over the world. It's really impressive and cool and most important helpful to lend your eyes out to someone who just can't see. I love it.,11/15/18 12:43,5
Be My Eyes,This app used to be wonderful and I enjoyed helping people... But the last three phone calls I have gotten it just continues to say connecting and doesn't allow me to look through their camera. I have double checked permissions and I have all of them granted. Hopefully this bug can be resolved soon.,01/01/22 13:15,2

Be My Eyes,I am a sighted person and was so excited to receive my first call today! The audio was clear and torch (flashlight) controls worked wonderfully. However the video would frequently freeze making it difficult for me to aid the caller. Overall brilliant concept and great app,11/05/19 14:18,4
Be My Eyes,I'm registered as a sighted volunteer . The App is super easy to set up . Calls come through as video call on speakerphone so you can see what the visually impaired user needs assistance with . Calls take only a moment . Well worth recommending .,08/17/23 12:17,5
Be My Eyes,This app is amazing. I was able to activate a flashlight and read the thermometer to help a visually impaired person. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to make a small but significant difference in someone’s life.,02/21/18 16:55,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,Awesome app! I love this app. It is awesome and accurate enough that I can tell what a bottle is. It’ll read the label enough on a round bottle so I can tell what it is. Awesome app continue the good work.,12/20/20 6:26,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app only thing is I wish I was contacted more.,11/15/24 4:24,5
Be My Eyes,Awesome App!! Something I can give back to the community,03/21/24 2:01,5
Be My Eyes,This app has been a Godsend for both the visually impaired and the volunteers eager to help. My only wish is that we could expand on this and allow for additional methods of communication and info sharing.,01/26/24 5:11,5
Envision AI,I really enjoyed the user experience in the service but I need help with the problem that I faced these days the app tells me that the free trial has expired but I subscribe to a lifetime subscription and I didn't use that free trial at all so i don't know what should i do with that,09/24/20 13:33,5

Be My Eyes,"I am a user of the app not a volunteer. I don’t use it often, because I don’t really like bothering people with my little problems, and generally try to find some way to answer my visual questions through AI. However that’s not always possible, and sometimes you just need that human touch.
Every time I have used it the volunteers have been wonderful, helpful friendly and just all-around great. I’ve never had a bad experience, and I’ve asked them to look at some unusual things.
Fabulous app and idea and God bless all of those who are willing to be volunteers, even if you don’t get calls much. Thank you for sticking it out!",02/08/24 0:34,5

Be My Eyes,"I was really excited to be able to participate in this program, but I have YET to be able to take a call to help out in.  First of all, this program clearly has far more volunteers than they need, which is great,  because I rarely receive a notification.  We are also told that calls are rerouted if a volunteer doesn't pick up.  That's an understatement: clearly calls are put out to numerous volunteers simultaneously, because I have, on several occasions, answered almost immediately upon being notified, only to be told EVERY SINGLE TIME that someone else has already answered.  I'm just thoroughly disgusted that I am not even given a chance to pick up.",08/11/20 3:21,1
Be My Eyes,"The concept of this app makes me so genuinely happy! I installed it on my phone yesterday and received a call just a while ago. Assisted somebody with reading stats on a machine. The call was under 2 min and feels good to have been of help to someone. I think there is no call history on there, I would love if it showed up a call log to track as to how many calls we've attended maybe along with the dates. To the devs, do consider this. The app overall is basic and very beneficial. Luv n regards💟",06/24/22 9:15,5

Thank you for making this app 💕💕",01/31/23 4:16,5

Be My Eyes,"What a great idea for an app. One recommendation I have is to have a setting for helpers so they can set their availability to answer calls, just incase some people work backshifts, that way they can still help but there isn't the risk of this app ringing for them if they forget to silence or Do Not Disturb mode their phone!",05/28/21 2:50,5

Be My Eyes,"I didn't get an experience. My phone rang, I was super excited, and hit accept. It then told me that I wasn't logged in, and can't accept calls if I'm not logged in (which I can accept and am sure is a minor fix) however, when I opened the app, I waited a LONG time with the blue circle trying to do its thing. I am going to Uninstaller and try to reinstall again, hopefully it will work next time.",06/16/21 17:02,2
Be My Eyes,"Great concept, sadly not the best execution with the app itself being not very user friendly (unintuitive to navigate, bugs preventing me from leaving feedback etc). I wish there was a way we could support/contribute to the app as developers, user researchers and designers to improve it. Feedback I wanted to leave but couldn't: I wish the visually impaired caller could leave some feedback for the volunteer. This could be text or a quick voice message. This would help volunteers be most useful",09/18/24 5:20,4

Be My Eyes,Really cool app! I joined in January and had my 1st call a few minutes ago. Person was home. I was asked if a sign was upside down and to read it. It was about pot. The person said they just stole it from the gas station. Am I am accessory to a crime now?,04/10/21 15:09,5

Be My Eyes,Easiest way to volunteer,11/01/21 9:38,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing. I signed up to help and got my first call a few hours later. I was initially confused because my screen went dark, but then a woman's voice said hello. Her question was whether her bathroom light was on or off. Considering I couldn't see anything, I told her it was off. She thanked me and we hung up. It left me feeling good about myself afterward.

If you're doing this at work, I'd recommend having a headset or your Bluetooth handy, since the calls use speakerphone if you aren't using one.",01/16/15 18:11,5
Be My Eyes,"Extremely helpful app for blind people. But while incomming call, the call page is not appearing to receive the call, I need to navigate to the app to receive the call. This is happening since I upgraded to new phone Samsung Galaxy M52, Android 11.",01/16/22 22:12,5

Supersense - AI for Blind,Your app is completely garbage in the United Kingdom it's an absolute disgrace try to get my money back through Apple no joy so I intend to fight you through all the social side side possibly can and if I can get one blind person to not even think about purchasing your app I have one that day your app is crap in the United Kingdom crap get it into your head head,12/23/20 10:47,1
Be My Eyes,"I love the idea of this app and I love that there’s people out there needing help and they can get this app and then have help. It’s a fantastic app which is why I gave it 4 stars.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because when you do receive a call if you don’t answer quick enough it goes to another person. For instance I just had mine ring and it rang for literally one second and I answered and it said “someone else has answered this call” which is disappointing because I was so excited.",10/14/20 23:54,4

Be My Eyes,"Excellent service for visually impaired. I’ve helped the amazing people seeking help. I live in Hawaii, it seems I mostly get the later calls because of time zone. They love my nights sounds of coqui frogs singing & Roosters who crow all night. I super love this App",07/21/24 0:18,5
Be My Eyes,"I really wish there was a way to tell the app times when you’re available to accept calls. I’ve had the app since back when it was originally released, and I think in all that time I’ve had maybe 6 to 10 calls. I’ve only been able to answer 2 of those calls because more than half the time the calls have come while I was driving to or from work. 

I’m not suggesting that volunteers *only* get calls during times they designate - I just wish there was a setting where I could say between certain hours on certain days, put me higher up on the list of people to call.",04/02/23 18:06,4
OneStep Reader,"Please add Hindi OCR also, please please",12/15/18 9:22,4
Be My Eyes,I've had the app for about 4 years. Got nothing for so long. I have answered 5 calls and all went pretty well. Great idea and those needing help are appreciative but we(those receiving calls) gladly do it! I really enjoy it.,02/02/23 22:41,5
Be My Eyes,It is great know that I can use my sight to help someone who has none.,02/26/20 14:31,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve had this app for two years and have only received 2 calls.  Both were very easy to navigate. It’s not overwhelming at all and is an awesome way to help people in my opinion.  I would actually like to receive more calls, but the fact that there are so many volunteers, making it less busy for everyone renews my faith in humanity.  It asks you when you sign up what language you speak and what time zone you’re in, and when you are available to help.  So you’re not getting calls from other parts of the world that you can’t help with and you’re not getting calls when it isn’t convenient for you.  I love this.",11/20/23 14:54,5
Be My Eyes,A wonderful app that lets you help people with their day to day life!,09/20/23 5:54,5

TapTapSee,"This app is just, great! Everything I take a picture of, it tells me what it is, and it's always right. I'd like it to be a bit faster when it gives me the results though. Besides that, it's perfect.",05/27/13 0:37,4
Be My Eyes,"It's hard to get on the phone. I get that. But when a sighted person gets on that line to help you… Listen to that person. I know it might be hard, but still… ""Blind man who leads puts everybody in a ditch"".

And especially if I am courteous enough to give you my name… You disrespect me again, and I'll clean out your filthy mouth.

No.",12/18/22 18:58,2
Envision AI,And the latest version of this app each time I scan a barcode no matter what it is it will tell me that the barcode is not recognized.

TapTapSee,Real good app for us blind.  😊,03/31/16 20:21,5
TapTapSee,I'm amazed both at this app's accuracy and that it's free. I'd pay good money to have an app that can distinguish between thousands of different objects. But you provide it for free. Just now I got two different pizzas out of the freezer and Tap Tap See told me what the flavour of each was. No longer do I need sighted assistance to help me sort out my food so I can label it. Well done whoever developed this app.,04/05/13 10:16,5

Be My Eyes,"As someone with a visually impaired relative this app was of high interest to me. I’ve been a volunteer for a number of years and I love knowing that I’ve made someone’s life a little bit easier. The calls can go through phases of being regular and then you can go months without an alert, but this is due to how many volunteers there are which is great! You do have to answer quickly too, but again, this is such a good thing for those needing assistance! It would be nice to see a total figure for how many calls you’ve answered, especially when showing friends or family the app ☺️",03/02/21 3:36,5

I feel so grateful and privileged to lend my eyesight to those who are blind or low vision.  This gives me a lot of faith in humanity and truly humbled me  I look forward to receiving more calls and assuring many others.,01/09/20 2:29,5

Be My Eyes,"Amazing - but talking to a blind friend of mine mine uses this app, I feel like a feedback feature may be needed? He has said that he has encountered a handful of people that were not helpful. I think it would be nice for people to be able to choose to not be matched with certain people again or to be more likely to be matched with others. Maybe this has been considered and it's not the best option or maybe the need to volunteer ratio is so different that it's just not an issue.. just a thought!",09/08/21 17:19,5
OneStep Reader,"Very good in my opinion for the price! In Romania I can not afford to buy the orcam device so this is the best replacement! And also is very good! I tryed it and is not good to live this 1 star review! You must try it and then you must live a review! I was so scared to buy it because of your reviews, but for me a future lawyer I am very glad to scan and read the Romanian law without a pc. If you are not satisfied whith the price just imagine how it costs to see! Do not misunderstand me! Is not cheep because romanian money are cheep so 1 usd is like 4.5 usd but my vision is more expensive then that! I am so glad that I can read !!! The reading devices are too expensive like the orcam my eye is 4 000 usd ! This is expensive not this app. Keep up the good work developers! Do not get descureged do this work for us for the people who need to read and who was borned whithout the capacity to read. Thenks a lot! And do not forgot that its good in romanian, the problem whith other apps is that they can not read good in romanian.",05/01/20 15:44,5

Be My Eyes,"When the Android version of this finally appeared, I was excited to have a chance to help vision-impaired people in such an ingenious way. (It also seemed to make sense for the developers to stop focusing exclusively on Apple owners—who are, in my experience, more likely to be preoccupied with style and status than ""the rest of us"" are.) However, after having it installed for months, and not getting a single help request, I'm giving up. I'm glad the volunteer response has been so overwhelming—better that than too few—but there's also something to be said for, you know, actually getting to help someone sometime..?",10/06/18 11:42,3

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Former iOS user blown away by how good this app is. Particularly impressed that I can point my phone at the TV across the room, and Lookout will read the menus currently on the screen when in text mode. Can't wait for the AI to come out.",07/12/23 14:00,5
Be My Eyes,"The concept couldn't be better!! I just helped my first person today but the video quality was so poor that I couldn't read what He showed me in the Facetime-esque screen. I had a blazing fast Internet connection too. Instead, there should be a more simplified option to send an HD snapshot image so the quality can be maximized due to bad internet.",05/13/15 4:29,3
Be My Eyes,Live to find out how real this app is,07/02/23 19:52,5
Be My Eyes,Getting these calls and being able to help people makes my day everytime!,02/05/22 21:58,5
Be My Eyes,This app is so easy to use! Most calls are around 1 minute long. Very easy to help!,05/09/18 21:44,5
TapTapSee,There are few times when you truly say WOW about an App. This is one of those times. Keep up the good programming!,08/23/15 13:59,5
Be My Eyes,Got my first call today after almost a year of having the app. yes it was a long wait but i’m still very grateful to have gotten the opportunity to help.,08/04/20 21:16,5
TapTapSee,Ples help,02/19/23 18:58,5
Be My Eyes,I am always excited to nab a call as a volunteer. It’s a great way to connect to other humans.,08/04/22 14:29,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,"Got the lifetime subscription for 50% off holiday sale, have been enjoying this app so far, given that my school blocks access to Seeing AI and most of the channels are restricted with Seeing AI, able to recognize multi page documents, wish it had a PDF OCR converter, but this app has extra perks such as currency and explore options, exploring options are referring to object recognition/identifiers, there’s also category specific look ups, you can select kitchen and start scanning and the camera will detect anything related to the category selected, The best function of this app is smart scanning, with this mode, all reading categories are selected, AI can detect what you’re trying to scan.  but there are several issues with this app, when opening the menu button to go to subscription options and other options, the back  buttons is not labeled with voiceover, also, when you try to purchase a second subscription on a different device, it will say you have already subscribed to this subscription, I don’t like the fact that it does not allow you to manually snap a document, everything is done automatically, wish there could be a manual picture mode for reading documents, but I do understand why the quick read functionality will not have a snap picture button, but I wish the document and multi document channels allow for manual picture scanning, also, Text that have previously been read should not be repeated when the phone is not held study,  also, sometimes when scanning using the quick read channel, there seems to be a lot of gibberish when scanning small text such as the model number of the CD player, the way to fix it is to have a manual capture option because when I used voice dream scanner, there was not as much gibberish because you have the option to manually take pictures. And lastly, I suggest that the app should have multi language document scanning functionality for premium users",12/22/21 1:51,5
Be My Eyes,"I am a seeing volunteer on the app and have been for some time now I feel the calls I’ve answered have helped those in need…I have answered maybe 3-4 calls from around the world, I have missed a few more due to faster responses elsewhere however the experience of helping those who are unable to see clearly or at all is invaluable to me and I hope also to the caller. This app is a great addition to the world.",01/16/24 3:34,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,The app is very basic. i would like if the app would highlight the object when it makes a determination.,03/18/19 9:55,3
Seeing Eye GPS,I have been to the apple store and neither my girlfriend or I can successfully subscribe on our iPhone fives. We took care of the restrictions and can still not subscribe...very disappointing :(,07/07/13 11:36,1
Be My Eyes,This helps so many with tasks you may think are simple but that others can’t do on their own.,08/03/19 5:10,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing! What a unique way to help others. I love this💙,02/02/21 12:19,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is such a fantastic idea. I have been able to assist people with reading instructions, locating product keys or differentiating between physically similar items. I very rarely get calls (once every few months at most) and the calls are always short (usually a minute or two). A very lovely and simple way to provide assistance to people when they need it. If you're a helpful person who can answer the phone every now and then, I highly recommend this app.",05/28/23 22:03,5
Be My Eyes,Although I have only helped 1 person it was a heart warming experience. Grateful to be able to help.,06/02/20 6:30,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app and every time I get to answer a call it puts a smile on my face. I tell everyone that day that I got to answer a call and help someone in need.,12/12/19 12:08,5
Be My Eyes,"I had my first call came all the way from England 
She didn’t necessarily need help at the moment, she was just checking out the app. 
We had a beautiful conversation and told each other to have a great day. 

I live in Florida. ❤️",01/30/20 19:44,5
Be My Eyes,"I really love the idea of this app and was looking forward to being able to help others. 

However since may last year, I have only had the opportunity to help 1 person. 

How do you evenly spread the calls across volunteers? Is it based on algorithms?",02/06/23 13:50,2
Be My Eyes,"I’ll gladly devote time to more complex issues, but so far I’ve had the super EASY privilege of letting a woman know that her milk was still good for two more days. I couldn’t believe how great it felt! This is such a GREAT premise! I can’t wait for it to be used for other needs! Old folks needing a ride, novices in need of expertise, bartering, there must be more of this concept in use!!",07/26/18 4:43,5
Be My Eyes,Finally an app that contributes something worthwhile. Simple and easy to use. Faith in humanity restored👍,10/06/17 13:13,5
Be My Eyes,I love ideas like this. I signed up several months ago and have only got an alert a handful of times and usually someone else beats me to it but one time I actually got to answer the call. It was someone who simply needed to know which of his shoes he had put on. Such a quick and simple way to lend a hand to someone. I love it.,11/01/21 9:34,5
Be My Eyes,Love this app so much. Love the ability to lend my sight to help when someone is in need of assistance. It’s brilliant.,05/07/24 1:32,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Please include Nepali language as well a lot of people from Nepal are also using this application so adding Nepali language will help us to recognise the text more easily,05/19/21 5:01,4
Be My Eyes,Installed the app 6 days ago and still waiting for my first call to assist someone. All of the notifications are turned on.,10/04/23 8:34,5

Be My Eyes,It's a great app to help people who need the help,03/28/23 2:35,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"Very fast , surprisingly accurate at times. but then completely off at other times",03/29/25 22:25,5
Be My Eyes,"I got my first call today. I was able to help a lovely woman pick out an outfit for her son to wear to church! My boyfriend was with me and he was so impressed by the app that he decided to download it too!

Edit- I brought it down to 4 stars because the call notification is sooo easy to miss. Out of the 9 calls we have received, we have missed 7.. it is so upsetting because I would really have loved to help. Please please please allow us to choose a louder call notification setting.. vibration would be an added bonus!",12/29/18 13:39,4
Be My Eyes,"This is a great App! I enjoy helping others & I enjoy answering calls. 
I’ve missed a few calls by being too slow answering & I get a little disappointed. I’ve answered a few calls & the other person on the other end your helping us very grateful. The app is user friendly & simple to set up.",04/03/18 2:43,5
Be My Eyes,"I have waited for 5 months and I still haven't gotten single call. I can't help the blind if no one CALLS! I think too many people found out about this program so it is very rare to get a call. 

I've concluded that I should just get rid of the app. So... cya!",03/04/15 2:10,3
Be My Eyes,"If you love helping other's & meeting great people around the World 🌎, then this is a perfect fit.",09/20/18 11:19,5

Be My Eyes,Love this,12/14/18 20:17,5
TapTapSee,Great very useful app are used it but then I deleted it and I thought when I went into the App Store and I go and I went to apps and then I then I was like swiping up with three fingers and then I found apps with voice-over and then I found a TapTapSee and I re-downloaded it and it’s a great app,04/10/19 8:06,5

BlindSquare,I've been using BlindSquare for a couple months now with the teacher and now all of a sudden I love blind square it is so awesome.smile thank you blind square for being invented for people who have low vision or no cited all.,09/04/15 20:52,3
TapTapSee,"Seriously! This thing’s ability to recognize objects is strange. It seems to be some mix between OCR and object recognition. I took the same photo from my library and put it into both google’s photo ID software (it gave back just “cat”) and into this and it identified the color and the HAIR LENGTH of my cat. Like… what!? 

Completely blown away by this thing’s power. All it needs is a better UI to go with it, but to be honest I don’t think that matters considering it’s meant for blind people, so a “fancy” UI will only make VoiceOver worse.",04/11/16 20:17,5
Be My Eyes,Excellent way to help the people,08/02/20 2:39,5
Be My Eyes,I just wish I was given an opportunity to help!,12/02/20 5:34,2
Be My Eyes,"Well, this app is brilliant. The only problem is, now that there's 1.5 
million volunteers, the chance for service is extremely minimal.",07/25/18 15:29,5
Be My Eyes,Try to answer call couple of time but not so responsev .says unknown error . Need improvment .good idea thou,05/07/22 13:33,2
Be My Eyes,"I had high hopes when I learned of the app. Still think it’s an awesome concept but after signing up in July, I’ve yet to receive a call. I’d love to help, and would love to receive a call & update the rating but I guess until I do I have to leave at 1 bc I’m still not sure it really works.",11/09/19 17:27,1
Be My Eyes,I’ve had the app for about 6mts now and I final answered my first call! It was a teacher who wanted to demonstrate how the app worked for one of her students. Regardless it was amazing! I love helping people!,06/25/22 2:56,5
Seeing AI,"Great app
Why isnt it available on Android.
It needs more language support",10/15/19 23:07,5
Be My Eyes,"This is an amazing app and I love being able to help people. I just got out of the hospital being in over a week and a half long, going through about 12 surgeries and dying once already in 2020(this all began in January). I am almost certainly guaranteed to no longer be able to work. It would be nice to be able to get more calls that way I can talk to more people and possibly even gain my friends.
I do understand that there are a lot more people signed up to help them or are that need help. But I feel like the algorithm should be skewed more towards the people that always answer their calls adequately. We also have no way of seeing our “review“ from the person being assisted. If this isn’t already feature it would definitely be nice to see.",07/02/20 12:47,4
TapTapSee,I use this for looking at all kinds of stuff from groceries to clothing,04/07/15 17:41,5
Be My Eyes,"I went to sign up as a sighted person, but the app demands access to my camera. I can't understand why it would need video of what's going on at my end, and it smells of spyware.",06/04/16 19:09,1
TapTapSee,I really enjoy knowing more about my surroundings!!,04/30/15 13:06,5
Be My Eyes,I just recently downloaded this app after seeing a post about it on Instagram. I haven’t gotten a call yet but I can’t wait to help with people with their everyday tasks. I already volunteer a bunch for businesses where I live but this is a different type of volunteering. Not only am I helping Americans but I am also most likely helping people worldwide. I just puts a constant smile on my face to know that a simple answer can help a blind person greatly. I can’t wait to get my first call so I can help someone in need.,07/29/22 15:09,5
Seeing Eye GPS,I would suggest that the POI categories be on the same screen as the screen that you search for them. I also think the option to adjust the speed at which it announces intersection and POI'S should be sliders directly accessible from the look around screen in settings. Overall awesome app for a pretty reasonable 3-year price. Gives me useful information that the built-in maps app and google maps don't give me.,02/05/14 5:01,4
Be My Eyes,Finally has arrived,10/12/17 23:08,5
Be My Eyes,"It is an amazing app. I’ve experienced it from both sides, as a blind person and as a volunteer.",02/19/24 23:56,5
Cash Reader for the Blind,"This app is super buggy and requires an expensive app purchase to halfway work. It’s not worth downloading much less buying. There’s no shortage of free apps that will read money and much more. Get Seeing AI or AIpoly instead.
  In response to the developer’s response, you clearly misunderstand your market. Lots of free and more functional apps are capable of reading foreign currencies Moreover most other foreign countries have a tactile means of readily identifying all of their currency by touch alone, therefore no app is necessary. America is an outlier in this respect there’s no need for your app in most other countries or the USA. This app is too buggy, too expensive, and a waste of time and money.",09/29/20 20:38,1

Be My Eyes,"Though my eyes are absolutely terrible (somewhere over 20/400…after that they stop measuring), my glasses mostly correct that.  I can’t imagine not having that remedy!  So, I’ve been a member of the “Be My Eyes” community for over 2 years.  Through video calls received on the Be My Eyes app, I’ve helped the blind and seeing-impaired identify cereal boxes, set temperature on new kitchen appliances, and a lot more that I can’t remember.  It’s a great experience for both you and the caller.  I encourage anyone to sign up and volunteer to be someone’s eyes.",11/05/22 23:15,5

Digit-Eyes,"I don’t often write reviews, but this app was so disappointing, I felt compelled to. In 15 minutes of trying to scan multiple items, even with sighted assistance, I was only able to scan one item using the app. And, that item wasn’t even in the database. Even when the camera was pointed directly at the barcode, the scanner did not pick it up. Please save your money, and buy an overpriced coffee at Starbucks.",05/22/18 20:38,1

Seeing AI,"A great app. Its a beta version but, its more then I expected. Maybe a feature recognizing objjects combined with the lidar technology would make the app perfect. I have some ideas I will provide. I give it a 4 but will give a 5 for the effort in such a short time.",04/18/22 20:09,5

OneStep Reader,I didn't read the reviews warning this is a scam but it is. If your product was good you wouldn't hide behind a paywall every single feature. That's not just shady but it's dumb. Not shockingly this app shared results in my googling with the also terrible Speechify,04/08/23 10:32,1

The same with trying to find a door and I thought my fireplace was my bedroom oh well.",07/20/23 14:22,1
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded and waited two weeks, with no calls for help. Then I thought, it would probably be much more runner to meet people if I pretended and signed up as a blind person. And I KNOW I'm not the only one thinking that. So there must be a lot of jokers, trolls, etc for example (can you tell me which testicle is my left one?) it seems there should. Be a way to validate if you are truly blind somehow...and again.. No instructions  ... I don't know if I have to have the app open the whole time or what. But sitting around for five or six hours til you get one call? Seems unbalanced. And a lotttt of flaws.. Though I do love the simple interface I just don't know what the heck I'm supposed to be doing",01/24/15 3:12,2

Digit-Eyes,"Once I got the technique for how to place and hold the phone, I got wonderful results with this application. Definitely worth the $. It was frustrating to use at first, but it was my scanning technique that was causing my frustration, and not the application. It works well.",05/06/12 2:14,5
Be My Eyes,This app is so easy to use and it’s great to be able to volunteer to help make someone’s day a little easier and all the more special too.,06/07/22 3:07,5
BlindSquare,"Even though the GPS is not great in my area, this is the first app I open when I get turned around in my town or need to know which train stop I am coming up to.  I also used this app extensively to mark my tent and other landmarks on camping trips.  This app gave me the option of being far more independent while camping. 
This is also the best app for identifying both the walking paths and parks along side the cafes and businesses that dot my town. 
I have 2 complaints. 
1 The bluetooth connectivity warning should not open every time that I open the app. Once is enough. 
2. The Tracking a location using the clock face or cardinal coordinates  takes a lot of practice and concentration.  It was very cool once I figured it out.",02/02/19 16:54,5
Be My Eyes,"Hello. Be My Eyes is terrific. I'm not sure how to discribe it: but those who have helped me are not condescending or hesitant nor overly ""take charge"" just plain helpful and efficient.
My only disappointment came today when I contacted someone for help in taking a photo of my guide dog's newest toy to disseminate. We got the toy lined up perfectly in no time. But, when I accessed the camera to take the photo, the volunteer lost sight of the item. I suspect this modification of the appp might be impossible, or maybe even worse than that? LOL! but someting to consider at any rate.",03/05/19 22:09,5
Be My Eyes,"1) You will try and answer and someone has grabbed the call already. But don’t let that keep you from using this app

2) The feeling you get for helping someone is totally worth the wait. I have been able to help a few people over the last year. And things so basic like reading cooking instructions or reading the dials on an appliance seem simple but to the person calling you know you’re a huge help. 

Totally worth it. 

Only thing that would be cool is seeing stats and where you are in a queue for your next call.

Do your soul and karma some good and get this app.",03/07/21 22:35,5
Be My Eyes,Such a great feeling after you are able to assist someone 😊,12/16/18 20:24,5
Be My Eyes,"To help others in this way, of course helps them, but does me so much good… by them Allowing me to help them, does me much more good than I could ever do for them!
I love the app!!!! God be with them!🙏🙏🙏",07/15/23 20:34,2
Be My Eyes,I LOVE that this app gives me the opportunity to help someone. I’ve taken one call so far and I’ve only had the app for a day. We were successful in the task that he needed me for!! It made my day!,04/18/20 4:06,5
Be My Eyes,So easy to use and so easy to be of help to someone.,09/11/21 2:32,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this app. I have had it about a year and love the feeling of being able to help someone with simple every day tasks. I have had 3 calls so far, one from someone in the USA asking me to identify the different currency notes, one from someone asking what the contents of various boxes were and one from someone asking me to look up a phone number for them. 
Such a wonderful idea, I get a lovely warm feeling at being able to help others.",09/22/24 12:45,5
Be My Eyes,Best app ever for the blind!!,10/04/20 15:19,5
Be My Eyes,"I am a volunteer, and I always get excellent picture & sound when ever I get the opportunity to help someone. 
This app is definitely life changing and it feels good to help someone in need. 
Keep the calls coming!",07/10/19 4:11,5
Be My Eyes,I just received my first call. I was nervous but after she asked her question it was real easy to help.,10/12/18 0:30,4
Be My Eyes,"Saw this on the BBC and immediately put my name down for the Android version which I downloaded a few weeks ago.. Brilliant concept and app which is a blessing for any blind person in need of information that can so easily and willingly be provided by a sighted volunteer.  I was so happy to assist my first caller yesterday to identify the colour of the dress she was showing me. It was so quick, easy and effective and made me feel good to be able to help a complete stranger .  This is such a wonderful and practical application of technology.",11/04/17 4:45,5
Be My Eyes,Genius and helpful app : ) just amazing thank you for who ever created it ♡,10/13/18 16:56,5
Be My Eyes,This app is so amazing. I love helping people who can’t see. Technology is very important now and days so why not make it useful. Hearing how people reply when I help them warms my heart. I will definitely keep this app on any device I come in contact with.,04/20/21 21:13,5
Be My Eyes,Great idea! Just wow.. I could help many.,12/16/21 22:25,5

Be My Eyes,This is such an amazing app.,03/31/23 17:26,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is, to me, the highest use of Internet technology that exists right now. It works well and I am thrilled to be a part of the “helper” community they have built. Thanks for making this brilliant public service happen!
I have a number of stories of my own experiences with the app, but will simply say that a moment of my sight is now a tremendously valuable gift I can easily give. I get as big a lift as the people I am able to assist.",07/08/18 0:57,5
Be My Eyes,I this is so awesome and I’m loving the opportunity to help out.... Just wish I get more calls....,02/20/19 13:08,5
Envision AI,this application was for subscription and I thought this application is very good and I was using it from early access but it suddenly bought a subscription which satisfied me and now it has become free for all and everyone is appreciating that so please go head download and use them and donate them if possible if you have ability and money to donate,07/22/22 0:05,5
Be My Eyes,"I was so excited to answer the call but when I picked up it was playing pornography on the other side. I was so shocked and humiliated and angry and disappointed. 

Such mixed feelings. I was so aspired by this app and truly want to help some day. 

I was trying to do good but experienced bad thing. I don’t wanna blame the app, but this type of thing needs to be stopped.

Why and how it could happen?",12/04/20 1:27,3
Be My Eyes,This app is a great idea and perfectly executed. For blind users this is great and there's so much help instantly at your fingertips. No long waits in ques for help just instantly answered. However for volunteers I don't suggest at this time downloading this app at this time because there's 2.5 million volunteers and only 137k blind looking for help. So many people want to help that it could be weeks or months before you get one call.,07/06/19 11:27,5
Be My Eyes,"This is one of the most amazing apps on the Play Store.  Huge props to the developers for making this app. It's really noble of all of you. Developers, volunteers everyone.",10/17/17 1:33,5

Envision AI,"Very useful and multi-purpose app. But one option is desperately needed, that is, multi-column view and single-column view.",11/19/19 14:55,5
Be My Eyes,I had a call coming in and when I answered it gave an error. How to go around this?,07/07/19 20:05,3
Be My Eyes,Waited weeks to help even once. Nothing.  Afraid they just wasted someone's grant or angel money. Really sad.,03/16/15 23:53,1
Be My Eyes,"Got my first call just now. When I tried to answer, it said an error had occurred and didn't connect. Pretty disappointed, and hope someone else picked up quickly to help them... Samsung Galaxy S9",02/05/22 13:58,2
Be My Eyes,"What just happened? When I clicked on the screenshot that was clicked within the call, app got closed. Need to fix that quick.",02/18/22 23:55,3
Be My Eyes,Being a RN.  I love seeing and hearing a call from someone!  We converse not only about helping them but just life in general! Thank you for allowing me to volunteer and help!,12/11/23 0:37,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve been able to answer two calls and help to the best of my ability! Both individuals were super sweet and we chatted for a bit also during the call. I love being able to take something that I take for granted most days and use that to help others live more independent lives. And for everyone giving 1 stars because they haven’t gotten any calls, look at the blind to volunteer ratio!",08/05/20 5:50,5
Be My Eyes,"Edit: I'm lowering my review as nothing seems to have changed. Now I can't even hear anyone, much less assist. I downloaded the app yesterday and got my first call today. I was super excited to help. For two minutes straight I could barely hear the person and got a ""trying to connect call"" message. I walked outside and disconnected from my wifi thinking that might be the issue. It felt terrible not being able to help someone when they called. I look forward to changing this review to a 5 star.",11/15/21 8:17,1
TapTapSee,"I don't even know where to begin in praising this app. I can identify canned  goods and frozen food easily now. I no longer have to worry about placing them in an exact position so that I can find them later. It's so simple for me to discover the brand name of the food that I'm buying, which allows me to log everything that I'm eating more accurately. I can identify money. I can take pictures of my cat and share them on Facebook. I can take pictures out my window to try to see what my cat is looking at out there. The possibilities really are limitless when it comes to what you can do with this amazing app. When you take a picture, the results come back quickly, and the descriptions are accurate and detailed. One of my favorite apps of all time.",08/10/13 23:29,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve been lucky enough to help a few people. Either shopping, working on a presentation and even sort accounting records.",03/30/22 15:51,5
Be My Eyes,everyone should use this app,01/19/20 15:24,5
Be My Eyes,So easy to help someone without having to do anything but talk and look at your phone. The app works very well and the joy of helping others never fades.,01/05/23 18:19,5
Be My Eyes,What a great idea. I’ve been unable to answer a few calls but I know they go to another volunteer so nobody is left hanging. The one call I was able to answer went very smoothly and I was able to help the woman locate the descriptive audio track on her DVD so she could enjoy her movie. It’s such an elegant system to help people with minimal hassle for either party. Really happy I installed it.,10/12/18 16:21,5
Be My Eyes,"Satisfaction Overwhelmed 🤍. Even though, it is not the great great job. Feels good.. As my best",06/16/22 22:38,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the idea behind this app. I’ve had it downloaded for several months now and I’ve gotten 3 calls so far, so it’s not something that happens too often. The first two calls were answered by someone else, but just the other day I got to assist for the first time. This is a small way I can help others without having to interfere with my schedule or plan it out. Do you have time to help? No, then okay, no big deal. If you do, awesome! I only wish more blind/low vision people knew about it. Perhaps some sort of additional outreach? Though I guess it’s a good thing that there are so many volunteers. It’s a great cause and I’ll continue to wait the next time I get to be of help.",12/14/18 23:14,5

Be My Eyes,"I just had my first call, I helped someone identify k cup flavors. They were so grateful and I was so happy that I was able to help! This app is amazing and so easy to use!",09/10/24 18:46,5
TapTapSee,I really love this application! It's accessible and blind friendly. I really think that there should be more applications like this that work well with VoiceOver to make the iPhone even better for those that are blind or visually impaired. : ),06/21/13 12:03,5
Be My Eyes,This is an opportunity to give back. I found the app works seamlessly. It was no different than FaceTime. I’m happy to be another resource for those that need help “seeing.”,06/29/22 0:51,5
Be My Eyes,It feels so good to feel like you are helping no matter where you are.,03/14/23 16:40,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"I'm not blind, but I think it's cool. It's VERY fast to say something, at least on my phone (S22 5G). Sometimes it is a bit wrong, like ""flower"" for plants, ""stairs"" for a fence. But if it can get better, and include distances, and maybe lane keep assist for walkers on a sidewalk, I think i'd try walking blindfolded.",07/30/22 6:57,5
Be My Eyes,"I’m volunteering and for now I understand how important this App for blind people. 
Check the meters. 
Turn washing machine correctly. 
Even help to shop online something. 
Some lady ask me how she looks and does she need to to dye her hair. 
And you even can’t imagine how important was the app in the first days of russian invasion in Ukraine. People call for help, for support and just to talk a little to not be alone in hard days. 
Thank you!",08/25/23 15:03,5

Be My Eyes,Great app,01/02/18 7:58,5
Be My Eyes,"This is the real experience behind support in the blind community and Making connections I never knew was possible! So far I have had 4 experiences with calls. My latest one was sadly answered quicker by someone else. On my first support call, the person was looking to ensure they looked good for a date. Not only could I say she was stunning but I was also in the meeting with an Ojibwe Alder who is then able to talk about body positivity and loving ourselves in our own skin. 5 stars",07/25/21 7:56,5

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted person, I don’t get frequent calls to help, so it isn’t overwhelming. I get to help when I can and I can decline a call if I’m unavailable. 
This app helps so many, and you feel great for having the opportunity to help. 
I have had this app for something like two years now, and I’ll never delete it.",04/22/18 17:46,5

One day if i lose my sight, I’ll be glad to have people like you who create and support this app available. 😊 much love",08/15/24 20:44,5
Be My Eyes,Just updated my phone OS and possibly this app updated itself I don't know but I've suddenly started being spammed by push noticications. The app tells me I have to have push notifications enabled for me to help people with limited vision. That's an absolute joke and I'm going to delete the app as I refuse to be spammed through an app where I'm helping people for free.,02/16/23 14:54,1
Be My Eyes,"It took a few weeks before I got a call but when I did it was totally worth it. It was from a blind man who had been taken to the emergency room and he wanted someone to describe the scene to him and help him get his bearings and to make sure there were medical personnel around. I can't imagine a scarier thing than being blind in the chaotic mess of an ER. 
This is the most awesome concept and use of technology I can imagine. Please encourage everyone you know to download it. It takes just a little time out of your day and it can mean the world to someone.",01/29/15 15:49,5

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I have been using this app for about three months now. I find it to be very user-friendly. It goes above and beyond what you see from similar apps like Seeing AI and Envision. Yes, you do have to purchase a subscription, but I think that it is totally worth it. The smart scan feature is awesome because it is intuitive and allows you to read or recognize a multitude of things without having to change between features. I especially love the barcode scanner. I find it to be very helpful and I love that you don’t have to manually go back a screen to scan the next barcode. You can just keep scanning product after product and getting results every time. I highly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or visually impaired. Check out the webinar on the blog of world services for the blind if you want to see some demonstrations",11/17/21 4:59,5

We chatted for a few minutes and I was able to look up the number on my computer (He said switching between apps on your phone will drop the call fyi!) 

Can’t wait to do it again.",07/25/19 16:24,5
Be My Eyes,"i'm giving 4 stars for the great idea of the app. However, you must add a feature that enable volunteers to select multiple languages as there are many volunteers who speaks more than one language so they can help more blind people.",09/20/22 5:20,4
Be My Eyes,This app is amazing I’m so thankful to be able to help someone out in need.,08/11/24 2:12,5
Be My Eyes,"Received my first call within days of signin up. But it was a man in another country just trying to flash the call recipient. The call ended abruptly after he appeared on camera pantsless and the option to leave feedback that pops up after the call didn't actually function. Like it was just for show. Obviously people can just sign up and abuse this app and I'm concerned there's no protection against this. Just ""call recipient beware"".",06/20/21 10:26,1

Be My Eyes,"A perfect example of how technology can make a tangible impact

It takes no time - I’ve only had a couple of calls in just over a year - but what an amazing concept, to link those who have sight with those who need sight support sometimes. It’s so simple.

We should have more apps like this, connecting people together that need can benefit from the connection",04/30/23 2:59,5

Seeing AI,This is just amazing. I can't think of a more purposeful application.,07/13/17 4:51,5
Be My Eyes,"I have logged into Be My Eyes and was hoping to see a feature that allows you to set an active time so that you won’t get a call when you’re unavailable, but saw that was not a feature. I would love to have that feature so it would be much easier for me to take calls and hopefully would be faster for those needing help because their calls would bybass busy people and go straight to available people.
Otherwise I’m really excited for my first call!",09/27/23 14:03,3

Be My Eyes,I got my first call this month. I helped a woman distinguish between the shampoo and conditioner bottles at her hotel. Was early in the morning and I took the call from the warmth of my bed in my pjs. Took less than 2 minutes. The woman was very nice. Felt good to start my day helping someone with something I take for granted. Definitely a win/win for everyone.,11/22/18 9:16,5

Be My Eyes,This is a great app. I'm a new volunteer and the man I helped with my first (and only call so far) was extremely grateful I could help him. He said even though the questions and needs may seem small they are a big deal to the blind community. It was also fun to have a short chat with him; someone who lives on the other side of the country from me but quickly didn't feel like a stranger at all.,08/16/21 16:21,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve been a member for several months now and have answered many calls. I love just helping someone with basic needs and questions. The first call is always the most nerve-wrecking but every call since then has been easy. Just be very clear and give them direction if you can’t see something clearly (raise your phone, turn it upside down, move left/right). 

I love this app and helping those who need it. If you’re reading this, I hope you love just giving back to others.",01/01/19 21:12,5
Be My Eyes,"This is an excellent app and has helped me out many times. I have spoken to people from countries all over the world who have helped me see needed things especially in a pinch.

I have nothing but 20 stars for Be My Eyes…I just wish I could answer a call. I’ve been enrolled as a volunteer for maybe a year or so now and I am never quick enough to answer but hopefully one day ! Thank y’all for what you have created, thank you helping give the gift of independence, something most of us take for granted. Y’all rock, Ty again and I can’t wait to answer!

Be My Eyes,"I have got 2 calls over the couple of years I have been on. The first one had poor audio and video and was disappointing in that I had to hang up. The second was awesome and I helped in reading a bill. Good feeling! I think you guys can improve the video tech and reduce the framerate required and improve the quality of each frame instead. I don't think fluid motion should be as much a priority. Better yet, allow us to control that.",01/19/22 19:39,5

Be My Eyes,"I tried to open a call and the message said only iPhones and iPads were available to answer. When I looked at the app download, it said I could answer using an Android. I hope the person got their situation figured out 🤷‍♀️",10/24/21 9:37,3
TapTapSee,Excellent app!! Very useful!! Keep up the good work guys!,03/08/13 14:20,5
Envision AI,"It's an interesting app, I never seen one similar before. I mean the scene recognition, the real AI deal. But unfortunately here the accuracy it's very low. This app it's addressed to people with visual disabilities therefore the actual interface is not good! It's necessary a simplified interface, bigger symbols and also voice commands. Good for testing but not quite an useful application.",06/02/19 16:13,3
TapTapSee,This app is a miracle for blind people.,04/21/18 9:59,5
Be My Eyes,I really enjoy this app as I get to help a person in need. I often get calls nightly and feel honored to help a visually impaired person. I recently spoke to one of the persons in need and they had a great idea of creating a Be My Ears App to help hearing impaired. Anyone out there who could create such an app?  Glad to help anyone who need assistance. 😀👍,01/26/18 9:51,5
Be My Eyes,I love to help the blind people,05/04/20 4:41,5

Envision AI,"This is the best app for OCR I've used, simple, fast and reliable. I am completelly blind and I've used it to even read books, banking stuff and small print. The fact that it works welll on older devices is a plus from other apps that needed great cameras. Thanks Envision!",02/16/21 10:24,5
Digit-Eyes,"This app is great for the price! I've only used it to scan UPC codes so far, and this has been very helpful for identifying items like canned goods in my kitchen. It took some playing around to find the best way to get the camera to capture the code, but it gets easier and easier with practice! I'm looking forward to using the other features!",04/25/12 20:00,4
Be My Eyes,Ive helped two people with very different tasks. The first was a man trying to figure out if his Covid test was positive or negative. What a relief to inform him he didn’t have it. The other was an elderly lady in a hospital who wanted to know the difference between two shades of red nail polishes. I let my girlfriend take the lead on that one. 10/10! Just get it!,02/02/23 2:36,5

Be My Eyes,So many to be helped and this app makes it possible. What a honour to be part of!!!,12/13/17 13:05,5
Be My Eyes,The apps usefulness has just been virtually destroyed due to the AI being blocked from describing any image that contains at least one persons face. Privacy seemed strong enough without taking away this feature. There are many images that may contain a person’s face and so this app now has very limited use as far as theAI feature is concerned,09/12/23 11:19,1
Envision AI,the app is totally awesome please keep up the good work I'm really fascinated with its ability to work in Arabic language sometimes while processing the pages with the lack of internet or even when it is poor it skips some pages I guess it is important to give a warning if it happened so that if I'm interested to read the full book with no skips the book i can do it and save my time,04/08/19 19:14,5

TapTapSee,"This is an awesome app! It is definitely the best picture app for the blind and visually impaired. The picture descriptions are usually correc, end it helps me a lot when I post pictures to Instagram or Facebook. Now, when someone sends me a picture I can just use the app instead of asking them what it is. I am so happy to know that the people who created this app were thinking of the visually impaired App Store users. I am also glad that they updated so you don't have to pay  after a limited amount of pictures.",08/19/16 14:40,5
Be My Eyes,Amazing app. So rewarding to help someone.,12/23/18 17:15,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,It is very nice app I knew just now and I check it I am using it from one hour I read that detail about this app it was launched in year 2020 so my suggestion is that to Google do advertise of this add so many more people will know about it please do YouTube advertise and blind NGOs and kindly don't stop working on it make it more reliable easy and fast,08/18/22 5:33,5
Envision AI,very excellent,04/23/22 16:28,5

TapTapSee,"This app used to be very helpful, like if I wanted to know what kind of juice we had, I would just pull out my phone and take a picture of the jug with TapTapSee and it would tell me the flavor and brand. Recently though, it’s gotten really bad. For instance; this morning I was making a bagel and cream cheese for breakfast. I knew what kind of bagels we had, but forgot what flavor cream cheese there was. So I pulled my phone out and go to take a picture of it with TapTapSee. It just told me that it was a white and blue container. So I thought “maybe it’s upside down, I’ll turn it”. Same thing happened again. It’s been doing this for a couple of weeks now, and I would like if this bug could please be fixed. I will change my review to the five stars it deserves once it gets fixed, but as of right now it is only worth one star",01/17/19 7:38,1

time when the app is not in use",07/16/18 6:15,3
Seeing AI,"I am not blind (and thank goodness), merely have failing sight.  But I cannot imagine being completely sightless and being able to utilize this app for anything.  The periodic pop up warnings and tutorial screens give NO auditory alerts.  So I could picture it being endlessly frustrating for someone who couldn't see the screen.  

That being said, this is an interesting display of advancements in AI visual interpretation.  It does recognize certain things, and even read a pill bottle label to me.",07/15/17 15:38,3

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Hi, the app is nice, but it doesn't have food labeled mode for South Africa, so please add that country. And that's all I would like for you to do.

Cash Reader for the Blind,I could easily identify United States currency but all other countries were either no identified or mis identified.

Very rewarding. It’s also heartwarming to know that there are so many volunteers from all over the world that even though I’ve had this app on my phone for months I’ve only received 2 calls, and have only been quick enough one of the times to be the one to help!  The man I helped said he uses the app frequently when he needs to, so it was great! Hope to be able to help someone else soon!",02/02/19 21:50,5

TapTapSee,"It usually takes a while, and many tries, to get a good picture, but it has come through for me on countless occasions.
I would give it five stars if they would make it repeat more than just the last picture taken, because sometimes you take a picture, and while you’re waiting you take another one, and the second one comes in far faster than the first so that you missed what the first one was, but the repeat only does the second. That, or they could just list the history of the last five pictures taken or whatever on the screen in text form.",03/14/19 23:01,4

Seeing AI,"Sometimes it says funny things but it still helps me a lot. Sorry if you can’t  I understand my review but that’s because I am using microphone access. And I am alone, without me I don’t. 

I am so very sorry if you don’t understand my review.
Let me get to the point it helps me, and it makes me laugh. I recommended for blind and visually impaired people and kids all alike. I can describe things and color scenery people money parentheses same thing this morning you can also described like you can read a book to you or document can you print read your homework if it’s not in braille 17! Anyway I’m only 10 years old i’m only 10 to 10 years old what do you expect for me like I’m just a kid what do you expect. I don’t do much when is my nap and I have fun and I love you and I love math that’s all that matters family and friends that’s why my daddy got me this app it’s quite amazing I enjoy it it’s wonderful I would recommend it for every single person in animal there is out there yeah animal just look at my rating of five stars I’m not kidding sorry if this review is so long but it’s for your own goods

I love cats I know I’m going to scream and this will help me to my dinghy mean cancel my Books app and brow on Tigard there for a little kids come on who wants to re-find your own books one who wants read books for five-year-olds when they’re 10 seriously seriously are you kidding me hello keep reading?!!!!!!!!! 

I recommend

I recommend that you add more things to your out to me why so I can see how old you are you know who is or you can like be used outside I tried it outside once and you didn’t work can you fix that?!

This is a really long long movie for teen! I am just trying to tell everyone how good this happens I heard the review about the stupid Facebook mission thing to wrong like I mean it just makes me laugh when I guess the wrong name I am too but I guess I was like five or seven or three or four and want to even make me want to sound all that and that he enjoys your new mother and younger image means one to your family sure I want to have friends over but it’s a pretty good app 

I do a lot of stuff anyway enjoy some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it another time it’s not a made in pain I had to giggle about that want to do you guys any new you I do a lot of stuff anyway I’m enjoying some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it and another tell me tell me an opinion I had a giggle about that want to do you guys any new people that say that something you know is kind of weird because it’s not working you guys might be right but you guys are wrong as well and you shouldn’t know if it’s wrong it’s just it’s not
 

Anyway I don’t know much and what was I saying oh yeah so people can just have a laugh about it instead of complaining to you guys everyone should have a box of medication laughter is the best medicine just take some funny pictures and have a good life and you should be cured that is the best medicine laughter is the best medicine understand if you can’t figure out what the medicine is when I ask ask someone who can’t see I can’t see really good myself out of me to reach mom. But I can still use this app why I want to say when you say well for some envelopes and I found all the information from my school on my own without

Once I even use this app to read envelopes and I found all the envelopes from my school on my own except for the set this up was my only guide you must just keep flipping the box with the Haitian around and eventually you’ll find the right spot that’s what I do with the envelopes sure he takes a while but after a while it’s worth it I love school it’s the best thing everyone just needs to chill lax it’s not a big deal. Everyone just keeps saying all this that this that blah blah blah it’s annoying so I need you to do people is to download this app my review should and if you more things

So anyway the next thing is to blow my true name I know it’s is with me and I will have you go to Abby Cool whatever I want I want to talk I think I don’t know I’m using voice so I don’t know why it’s wrong here is my true identity and the next thing he wake ups

My real my real identity
Weeequyteers saiiuuoplkjuyycxxzqzxzwzxfgxjcxxzzzz morning was 

I am not joking that is my true identity name I’m about to send this review goodbye and have a great day

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Google your application is very good, we also add Hindi language to it for the visually impaired, because we also use this app from India, if you insist on Hindi language in it, then it will be very useful for us, this application made by you With folded hands, you request that you add Hindi language as soon as possible.",09/01/20 22:54,5
Be My Eyes,"I have been enrolled to assist since October of 2018. Over the years I have answered many calls. Putting myself into each situation and encouraging each caller as I assist gives me a smile and knowing that I can help. 
I have answered 3 calls most recently that are things that (sighted) people might take for granted. 
1. A lady was given a new stove and needed to verify the knobs for burners, and that she had the oven on, and help setting the temperature and timer. We also verified the shelves located inside and we changed them. She was so excited to use her new stove, and I shared the excitement with her. 
2. An older woman was sick and had new medication brought to her from the pharmacy. She needed to read labels and take notes to be sure she was taking it correctly. 
I know braille might be very helpful if the label came that way. Maybe someone will invent it. I reassured her to call us if she was uncertain even a little bit. And with my (our) helping, she said it gave her so much relief from anxiety. 
3. A college student had a new computer given to her and it was set up for her sight issues. She had turned it on and could tell the color emitted was not what she was use to. I described the screen and explained in order the icons down the left side. I know about basic set up and we reviewed some things she needed to know had the vocal assist set up. We even changed the background color to what she had been use to on her other computer. I shared her excitement for her new gift. 

As I said simple to assist with but each were so grateful.

Be My Eyes,I’m ecstatic that I was able to help someone out in their time of need. The app was seamless and worked beautifully. The view was clear and crisp and the sound was sharp. Can’t wait for more calls to come! What a great concept for those of us who want to help others but are sometimes unsure as to how. 💞,05/16/19 19:07,5
Be My Eyes,I think Be My Eyes is a good app,12/17/23 13:47,5
Be My Eyes,Such a great concept. I feel very happy when helping someone like this. It's a bless to be able to give a helping 'eye' for people in need.,10/14/24 6:16,5

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,It was amazing a free app that let me cross streats safely. Oh wait an update comes and now instead of an optional donation to help the team make Oko. It’s not required to pay a subscription to use Oko. I think it’s cruel that we are now charging blind people to have the ability to cross the street safely.

Be My Eyes,Needs an option to help with text-to-speech instead of just using live calls.,12/18/17 20:17,5
Be My Eyes,"Can’t say too much about how well the App works. As I’ve only been contacted for help about 4 times and only once did I actually connect to assist.
And that’s over about a 3-4 year period(I’ll come back to this in a bit).

It’s an absolutely great idea of how to improve people’s day to day lives. With minimal impact on either party.

How great is it to have a simple App that allows a person to gain almost instant assistance. Without the need for anyone to be around.
As soon as heard about this App I downloaded. Just thought, why wouldn’t you sign up to help others especially when you don’t really have to do that much.

However as my title say, you gotta let people know about this App. And not only people with sight but with people with sight issues.
There are just short of a million helps signed up but only 67k people with sight issues. And that’s are figures for worldwide. Hence why I’ve had so few people call for assistance.

So, download the App. Tell people about it and get them to do likewise. Please.",04/11/18 6:56,5

TapTapSee,"App can recognize any object, place, part, thing... Just point the camera, take a picture, and it will accurately speak what is in that direction.

BlindSquare,"Well, I been looking for a decent application for GPS navigation. I've had a lot of them, but this is the best one out there. Especially when you're on a city bus, and the automated announcement system is not working. This is CVS number of times. Will read out your intersections as your past. If you want, it will also read out the points of interest that you were passing. And of course you can specify the radius and what you want to search for interest. You and if you want to search for individual interest points, you can do that. All of this is supported. So, what more can you want? Perhaps turn by turn directions? Well, maybe this coming up in the new version. However, I can't say enough about this application. I highly recommend it.",09/24/13 23:27,5

Be My Eyes,I think this is a great service for those who can’t see. I’ve only received 2 phone calls and they both went well.

BlindSquare,"I've used BlindSquare for around a year.

I'm getting better and better at using Simulate Location and My Places to build my mental map of intersections and points of interest where I plan to be.

While I'm walking or riding, I mostly use my Braille Sense with app sounds turned off, iPhone muted, and volumes set to 0.
I find BlindSquare very difficult to use in this fashion, so Ariadne GPS is my main ""where am I?"" app, and I love exporting places from BlindSquare to Ariadne GPS.

In other GPS apps, I can make the braille display tolerably stable while I'm moving, but,  in BlindSquare, I have a hard time reading and navigating the screen (using my Braille Sense) unless my GPS location is stable.

At some point, I'll get into the place check-in feature, but I'm still mounting the smartphone mentality learning curve.",03/16/15 14:03,4

With Meta's new VR glasses which is much more useful, & cost just US$299, everything EnvisionAi tries to sell is obsolete, useless & grossly overpriced at over 10 times!

Be My Eyes,"Great app, loved the idea. One suggestion if I may; add an ON/OFF option at the app's home screen where I can activate receiving a help request, as I might be in a meeting, asleep or even low on GSM data where I can't accept calls, by this everyone can activate the app whenever they are ready to lend a hand and by this saving time for the requesting part not to wait longer for the app directing the call to others if the first didn't answer.",01/19/19 7:29,5

I am noticing the smoothness of the speech at line breaks is a little long, the numbers under a barcode are read as a full number at first but then as individual numbers, there's nothing to let you know how a found item will signal with the beep before it happens, the ai description is accurate.

I love how it will give you cooking directions or if you’re looking at a DVD it will tell you what the movie is about. I have not tried out the money Channel yet but from what I have seen in  videos it works well. I also love using the document channel for reading mail. The handwriting mode also works great. My husband and I tried it out and we both were amazed that it read his handwriting. It told me Exactly what he wrote without any mistakes. It is small things like being able to read a handwritten note from a friend or family member that really makes this app special. I would love to see medication be added to the bar code scanner.

BlindSquare,"This is a great app when it works. I like the flexibility of ways to be able to search, and I also like that you can add filters so that you don't have to hear about things that you don't have any interest in. I had an experience of traveling to another city where I had never been before, and while I was there, it was nice to be able to hear things like street names, addresses, and  other types of information That people who can see often fail to tell me. My only disappointment with the app is that there are some plazas where the location information that they give you is not correct. I have had experiences of going into a place that I know, and BlindSquare still telling me that the place is 100 feet away. I go to this plaza often, at least once a week, so I know the information was incorrect. I have contacted the developer about this, and the person explained to me that they use their maps from outside sources. I had gone into their tools menu, and try to set the location manually. The action was excepted, but BlindSquare still insisted that I was not in the place where I knew I was. I realize this is out of their hands. I also realize that living in a small city, we're not as likely to be updated as bigger cities with more people. I think this would be a good tool, but I still think there's a lot to be said for knowing your orientation and mobility. The Thought behind the app is a great idea, and I will still continue to use it for where I can.  I look forward to future updates that may help fix this problem.",10/09/13 19:35,4

I am so very sorry if you don’t understand my review.
Let me get to the point it helps me, and it makes me laugh. I recommended for blind and visually impaired people and kids all alike. I can describe things and color scenery people money parentheses same thing this morning you can also described like you can read a book to you or document can you print read your homework if it’s not in braille 17! Anyway I’m only 10 years old i’m only 10 to 10 years old what do you expect for me like I’m just a kid what do you expect. I don’t do much when is my nap and I have fun and I love you and I love math that’s all that matters family and friends that’s why my daddy got me this app it’s quite amazing I enjoy it it’s wonderful I would recommend it for every single person in animal there is out there yeah animal just look at my rating of five stars I’m not kidding sorry if this review is so long but it’s for your own goods

I love cats I know I’m going to scream and this will help me to my dinghy mean cancel my Books app and brow on Tigard there for a little kids come on who wants to re-find your own books one who wants read books for five-year-olds when they’re 10 seriously seriously are you kidding me hello keep reading?!!!!!!!!! 

I recommend

I recommend that you add more things to your out to me why so I can see how old you are you know who is or you can like be used outside I tried it outside once and you didn’t work can you fix that?!

This is a really long long movie for teen! I am just trying to tell everyone how good this happens I heard the review about the stupid Facebook mission thing to wrong like I mean it just makes me laugh when I guess the wrong name I am too but I guess I was like five or seven or three or four and want to even make me want to sound all that and that he enjoys your new mother and younger image means one to your family sure I want to have friends over but it’s a pretty good app 

I do a lot of stuff anyway enjoy some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it another time it’s not a made in pain I had to giggle about that want to do you guys any new you I do a lot of stuff anyway I’m enjoying some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it and another tell me tell me an opinion I had a giggle about that want to do you guys any new people that say that something you know is kind of weird because it’s not working you guys might be right but you guys are wrong as well and you shouldn’t know if it’s wrong it’s just it’s not
 

Anyway I don’t know much and what was I saying oh yeah so people can just have a laugh about it instead of complaining to you guys everyone should have a box of medication laughter is the best medicine just take some funny pictures and have a good life and you should be cured that is the best medicine laughter is the best medicine understand if you can’t figure out what the medicine is when I ask ask someone who can’t see I can’t see really good myself out of me to reach mom. But I can still use this app why I want to say when you say well for some envelopes and I found all the information from my school on my own without

Once I even use this app to read envelopes and I found all the envelopes from my school on my own except for the set this up was my only guide you must just keep flipping the box with the Haitian around and eventually you’ll find the right spot that’s what I do with the envelopes sure he takes a while but after a while it’s worth it I love school it’s the best thing everyone just needs to chill lax it’s not a big deal. Everyone just keeps saying all this that this that blah blah blah it’s annoying so I need you to do people is to download this app my review should and if you more things

So anyway the next thing is to blow my true name I know it’s is with me and I will have you go to Abby Cool whatever I want I want to talk I think I don’t know I’m using voice so I don’t know why it’s wrong here is my true identity and the next thing he wake ups

My real my real identity

BlindSquare,"I'vb used this app since 2013 and I love it. The biggest problem I've run into is that it reports inaccurate addresses and street names when I make turns. The only correct information it reports for a time is the direction I'm going, and that's how I know what street I'm on. Like someone said in another review, you have to have familiarity with where you are or you'll be totally confused. I live in the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area.",05/02/19 9:14,4

Be My Eyes,Sadly an app designed for someone with limited sight doesn't work if you have limited sight.  My phone is configured using the accessibility features for the iPhone and the app's design isn't capable of supporting this feature.  Disappointing...,07/25/15 3:11,1
Cash Reader for the Blind,"This app is incredible. I love how I can scan any kind of money from  around the world and get instant feedback on what the denomination of the cash is. I was sad to see money reader go, but cash reader is the ultamate app for determining the denomination of the bill.  I love the fact that I can just pull out my phone and hold up the bill and immediately get virbal feedback on how much it is worth. For years I have been struggling to find the right app for reading money but now, I don't have to do that anymore. I strongly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or low vision and is tired of fumbleing around with  loose bills or having to ask someone to read your cash to you. It is the best talking money app identifier  out there.  I will never go without my cash reader out and ready to go again.",05/30/21 10:34,5

Be My Eyes,"While this is a very helpful app for the visually impaired to get help from others through a call, it has following shortcomings: 1. The ""problems"" button don't work after a call ends. It accepts only the ""thumbs up"" feedback after the call and not the ""thumbs down"" button. Probably the developers don't want to accept a negative feedback of any calls? 2. This app doesn't have a screen sharing feature. I have many callers who want to setup their new phones but do not have another phone with them",07/25/24 1:53,4

Be My Eyes,"I am an Optician and have had to see a lot of people dealing with visual loss and how it can impact their daily lives.  I have been a member of Be My Eyes since 2018. In that six years I have answered dozens of calls and I can tell you it is one of the most rewarding things. I remember this one call I received the gentleman worker at a store were he stocked chips. They were suppose to stack the boxes with the labels out for him, but the last person did not.  We had to find the Frito lays but we could not.  I told him I was not in a hurry and about 10 minutes later we found them!! I could tell he was really stressed when the boxes were wrong but we figured it out together.  That’s is what makes this app so great.  People like him do not need to do it alone, we got you!!! It is one of the most rewarding things to help someone feel independent.  If there was a way to give this app more then 5 stars I would.",02/05/24 1:08,5
Be My Eyes,I've been a member of this site for about 2-3 months now and I have not helped anyone.  I haven't shared this on Facebook and Twitter.

Be My Eyes,I honestly would love to give this app 5 stars. But the truth is I've installed it and registered for help over 2 years ago and I never received any request of assistance. I set the language as Italian cause that's the language I'm more comfortable with. Kind of disappointed :-/,10/08/19 15:27,3

Be My Eyes,"My very first call a woman had lost her meds they fell beside the couch. With her ordinarily ordered arrangement now in a disarray she wasn't sure which meds were which. It seems like such a simple thing, the blessing of sight. And to be able to share it with someone and know that they are living independently and safer gave me the strongest feeling of community belonging I think I ever felt. She helped me. God gave us all something to give. What you choose to do is up to you.",05/08/21 8:02,5
Be My Eyes,My phone rang and the moment i answer the phone.. it says some other volunteer answered the call. This has happened 3 times with me,07/07/21 0:41,2
Be My Eyes,This app is suspicious. I was encouraged to join on LinkedIn. Since thenn haven't received one single call asking for assistance. Do with that what you will. Tread cautiously.,07/10/23 15:40,1
Be My Eyes,I’ve been on this app as a sighted person for 3 years and today I had my second call. The one problem is that I am overly enthusiastic. I’ll temper it down. But helping out via modern technology really rejuvenates my soul. Thanks Be My Eyes!,09/20/23 0:07,5
Be My Eyes,I downloaded it and nothing works except settings and stories.,01/20/20 23:47,1
OneStep Reader,I like everything I’ve learned about the new version. The access to one drive and Dropbox is great. Batch processing is greatly improved—telling me how many pictures I have taken. Saving and deleting files is now stable. Having the option to save and view files as PDF is a good addition.,05/26/18 12:53,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,"I have just recently installed this app on my Samsung Galaxy s9. however, so far, this app is extremely good, and very accurate!

Seeing AI,Remember the days of standalone scanning machines and the minutes we had to wait for each single page of error filled  readings. This app is nothing short of miraculous and it's ability to read in real Time with 99% accuracy is nothing short of miraculous. Thank you Microsoft keep up the good work!

Be My Eyes,"This app is a phenomenal idea and I love how it works! Within the first few weeks of becoming a volunteer I was able to answer two separate calls; both visually impaired people were so kind and appreciative for the help, and I felt great being able to assist them with small tasks in which I take my own vision for granted. With millions of volunteers and only a few hundred thousand members who are visually impaired, calls are far and few between. I personally even know many people who are not blind but are visually impaired in some way and would benefit from an app like this if they got over that sense of “pride” and just asked for help. I hope this app continues to gain popularity and help those that need it!",04/30/21 2:31,5

Cash Reader for the Blind,"I like the vibration feature, which announces the denomination in a non-verbal way. I also like that you can recognize bills without a data connection. Money Reader could do this, but you can no longer download that from the App Store. Depending on your use case, this may still be a better option, as it recognizes many currencies Money Reader did not. Also, as new bills with different designs come out, since Money Reader is no longer in deveropment apparently, Myoung Reader will likely not recogniue those. This app also does a lot of curency recognition not found in apps such as Seeing AI and iNote. Both of these apps are free, but you get what you pay for.",05/18/20 11:08,5
Be My Eyes,"""Be My Eyes"" is truly an amazing app for the visually impaired. I don't think there is any better app than this. Although there are other apps, they all have different purposes, different methods, and different functions. 👀✨I like this thing in the field of the blind: no one operates in a big or small way. No one is a senior or junior; no one is in a queue. Everyone has their own unique work. 🌟",11/11/24 15:16,5

TapTapSee,Great app very useful. It's a great app finally technologies beginning to catch up with those who need the most. However this app has a very bad for all you have to keep paying for credits! Which was not in a description of the app if that is the case you have to pay for credits in order to use the app it needs to be on the description bar however this is a wonderful yet at an extremely useful. I will continue to buy credits because what else can you do if you need the app. However I think it is wrong to make you pay for something you need. Period.,01/28/14 15:12,4

Be My Eyes,"I love this initiative. BUT, I tapped through the post-call review much too quickly and accidentally flagged it as negative... How do I change that. I do not want to leave a negative review of a caller that was perfect and genuine. Please help.",07/28/21 0:17,5

Be My Eyes,"Have called twice now. Each time comma something I have been looking 4 It's found within Ten minutes.great service Period enthusiastic volunteers period And the only reason I don't use it more, is because I can't think of any ideas of how to do so period I don't need anybody to read to me period I Can I read. labels on grocery store products period. I do pull out the magnifying glass. That enlarges what I see by about 4 times frequently enough. But for some reason it doesn't occur to me to use",10/01/23 20:28,4

Be My Eyes,Very easy application,11/13/17 0:07,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such a simple yet genius idea, and it works so easily and well! As a sighted but chronically ill person, I often feel like I’m not able to help others as much as I’d like, and this app gives me an opportunity to help in a way that I can, from my own home. It is so fulfilling to help a stranger, even in such a small, mundane way, and it reminds me that we all have things to be grateful for.",03/10/22 20:30,5
Be My Eyes,"This is really a fabulous resource for almost any kind of help:  identifying stains in clothing, flavors of soup, sorting junk mail by the return address, and more.",04/25/16 11:39,5
Be My Eyes,"After I got sick with cancer and had an immediate life change I knew I wanted to do anything big or small to help other people. 
I came across this app and immediately knew it was for me. 
I’ve only probably had about 10 calls overall in the past 2 years I have been a volunteer, but every time it’s been a warm, honest experience. 
I love to help. I love to feel connected and know that I helped one person that day. 
Brilliant app. Wonderful people on both ends. 
Im proud to be a part of this and continue to do so indefinitely. 

Marielle",01/27/22 5:27,5
Be My Eyes,New to this app. What a wonderful idea! To be able to help someone and at the same time have peace knowing that if you miss a call. There are 9 other people to get the call. I will be recovering from surgery for several weeks. What a wonderful way to be useful to someone else. God Bless for the opportunity.,11/17/22 12:15,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is an amazing tool for people with low or no vision. As a volunteer and mother of a child who is totally blind, I think this app has given me as much as it gives the blind people using it. To see how many people have volunteered to help others is incredible.",03/19/19 0:56,5
Be My Eyes,I loved it. Made feel good to help others . Great app for great cause,11/28/18 18:33,5
Be My Eyes,THIS WAS AWESOME! I helped as a volunteer for my first time within 5 SECONDS of downloading and signing into the Be My Eyes app! She needed help with reading & selecting her desired washer settings. I was able to activate & deactivate her phone's torch/flashlight in her dark basement to see her washer and navigate her on the phone's angle to be able to see what buttons she needed to push. THIS WAS SO AWESOME! Best use of crowd sourcing EVER imagined! BEST VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE EVER! FROM HOME!!!,09/18/22 12:10,5
Be My Eyes,"I needed to change the setting of a thermostat, and turn it from AC to heat. This app connected me to a very kind and helpful woman, who helped me to do so.

Be My Eyes,"My best friend is blind, and relies on this app quite heavily. I also use it as a side guide. It has been a phenomenal benefit both for him and for me, as it gives one a chance to connect with someone in need, and helps to make the day a little easier. I cannot recommend this app enough. I’m going to have my students download it!",04/01/25 15:16,5
TapTapSee,"In less than two days, it's proven itself to be nearly indispensable to the visually-impaired.  Out of hundreds of pictures taken--everything from the sky, to a ceiling light, to a road, to a vacuum, to a car in motion, to a parked car, to a chair, to a crock pot--there was only one time it was tripped up, and that was forgivable; it mistook a white bathmat hanging on a towel rack for a white bath towel.  The program tells you when lights are on or off, whether the skies are blue or cloudy, and so on and so on.",04/20/15 13:14,5
Be My Eyes,This app provides such an incredible opportunity to connect with another person.  It’s such a great idea and couldn’t be easier to use and enjoy.  It always brings a smile to my face!,04/23/18 16:20,5

Be My Eyes,It's feels so good to help others using this app.,06/15/21 7:54,5
Be My Eyes,"Got couple of calls from within India in few languages that I know. But problem is the a/v quality is bad. It is highly possible that the caller is using data 3g. In data connection, video is bad and disturbs audio. In whatsapp video vs audio call, can easily find the difference. So it would be great if the caller is allowed to Pause the video and talk Show static picture from gallery (caller shows doc but zoom not good. they struggle with zoom) Record the call&playback (good for students)",12/31/18 8:38,4
Be My Eyes,There are some bugs that when a person calls you for help the video quality is too low and the vioce is cutting agin and again and when the app asks you about the PROBLEM or GOOD Option it dosent matter how many times you click of the problem option and when you accidently click on the good option it take you to the good reviews to give section *KINDLEY PLEASE RESOLVE THIS ISSUE THIS IS FOR HELPING THE COMMUNITY*,12/10/22 22:37,1
Be My Eyes,This is such a great way to help others virtually. Wether it is asking for clothing advice or how to work a new phone. A nice way to be helpful anywhere at anytime.,05/20/20 19:24,5
Be My Eyes,My first call I was actually scrolling Facebook on my phone and was so thrilled I tapped away! The dear sweet lady was needing help identifying cleaning products. It is such amazing technology and I praise the person/people that thought of this! I told my office mate about this app her son is visually impaired we discussed that it's a comfort knowing that when he is older there will be not only be amazing technology as this but possibly more advanced technology to help him live more independently!,07/30/18 0:53,5
Be My Eyes,This app doesn't work on Android. I was able to answer a call but could not see video. Please fix the app so I can actually use it to help someone. I felt so useless.,10/25/21 18:33,1
Be My Eyes,I like the idea!,05/08/18 18:34,5

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded be my eyes a couple years ago with zero expectations. I have some vision issues and have been told I will eventually go blind, so I figured I would help while I could. It started very slow, maybe 2 calls the first year. Now I average a call per month. These calls have ranged from helping with outfits, reading bills, and my favorite, a positive pregnancy test. Be my eyes has been such a reward and blessing for me!",05/06/20 15:07,5
Be My Eyes,"Hi I am from pakistan and I am blind person. This app is very useful.

Be My Eyes,"I just had my first call & what a joy! I helped a woman with the instructions to cook her veggie burger & I eat the same ones! Then after I read the instructions I helped her locate the bar code as she has an app that will give her info but she had been struggling with finding the bar code. I have MS & Lupus so I often need help from others so it was such a joy to be able to help someone else in a way that is so easy.  You’ve really done this well.  The app works seamlessly.
Thank you for allowing so many people to be of benefit to so many people.

Be My Eyes,I am a visually impaired person and I keep calling but nobody answers my calls and also when I click on the specialised help everything is close this app is stupid and never helps with anything and why the age is 17+ why cannot the kids this app is dumb and stupid stupid app this is my opinion I think this app must go away forever it won’t work and it won’t help any blind or visually impairment,05/27/21 19:03,1
Envision AI,The app has become my money and I want nothing with me and I use this app to help me want it for free😭😭😭,11/26/18 20:19,5

Be My Eyes,Such an easy helpful to others app.  Seriously easy!,03/26/19 2:43,5
BlindSquare,The app is pretty good overall. But you have a couple bugs to figure out. Like you should update on your locations. And when you’re coming to a corner it should say what two streets you’re at. And the accuracy should be a little bit better than 16 feet.,09/24/22 1:41,4
Be My Eyes,What a great service for those in need. Genius.,06/22/21 18:49,5

Would highly recommend EVERYONE to download and/or spread the word!!",11/27/20 2:12,5
Seeing Eye GPS,"There are just too many flaws with this app in it's current state. BlindSquare does nearly all the same things for a much more affordable, one time price, and it does those things far better. Save your money!",07/04/13 7:28,1

Be My Eyes,Glad to be part of the Be My Eyes volunteer community. This app is a simple yet ingenious way for those people with vision challenges or sight loss to get assistance quickly with everyday tasks.,09/27/22 14:56,5
Be My Eyes,Is there no way to set a schedule to not get calls at 4am? Then become available again the next day? Just a thought...,10/06/17 21:23,3
Be My Eyes,I wish I’d come up with such a special kind of app!,02/28/18 14:52,5
Be My Eyes,"Great resource. There are so many more volunteers that people who actually need help. Which is fantastic, however, the app is taking space and I've never used it in the month I've had it so I may end up deleting it if I'm not needed. Keep in mind that this just means that they are already receiving help from someone else, which is GREAT. 💕 So happy that there is a resource like this for the blind. 😊",02/10/20 9:15,5
Be My Eyes,"I received my first call not long after signing up and helped a blind person. They wanted me to tell them if a piece of bread looked moldy and if an avocado looked ok. I was glad to be able to help them.
8/30/2018 I love this app and being able to help people. I wish that I would be able to write a short description of any glitches though. The only option you get at the end of the call is where there any technical difficulties yes or no.",08/30/18 21:31,5
Be My Eyes,Every experience has been amazing!,11/30/18 6:24,5
BlindSquare,"This app is trying to be a better version of around meGPS, and my way  However, it is doing none of them really well. This app reads to you in a non-voiceover voice locations nearby. It does a good job of using the foursquare database to find locations that are near you. However, the filtering, targeting, and other features are hard to get at.  Especially, when the app is reading to you.  Also, it's integration with voiceover is poor. The volumes of  voices can be different, they can be reading at the same time, and other problems come up. 

In short, the app is hard to use, uses an unnecessary voice, and is not doing what is been designed to do. We should wait and see what happens next but this is not worth $12 right now",05/26/12 16:05,1
Be My Eyes,I love this,09/25/22 23:44,5
Be My Eyes,Have been answering calls for the impaired for years! Fantastic idea :) app works great!,05/14/23 19:55,5
Be My Eyes,Awesome!` great response it's instant clear and on point,04/25/22 17:59,5
Seeing AI,"The app isn't too bad, has its uses especially for OCR on the fly of text and documents, but I give it one star because it keeps prompting me to accept the terms of use and resets all my preferences and shows the tutorials again. It does this, what, every couple of weeks or so? Make it stop!",08/09/24 12:27,1
Be My Eyes,"I think this app is so cool, it’s easy to use as a volunteer and it warms my heart knowing I’m helping someone. I think it’s a great tool to give people another sense of security awhile being independent.",09/04/20 16:05,5

Seeing Eye GPS,"I try this app on a short 1 mile walk. Everything seemed to work quite well. It gives street information in real time, and has plenty of lead time when instructing to turn.
The downside is, the subscription price is a little high, many people have expressed concerns about this price. Although, it works out to $.21 a day, some people cannot afford to put out this type of money for this app. It may be advised to have a monthly subscription, which may be more affordable.
I would like to see the ability to browse a virtual route like the old humanware trekkers  were able to do. When I had my trekker, I use this feature a lot.",07/02/13 11:18,4
Be My Eyes,"I have only use this app I handful of times, but every time it was a huge help. The most memorable was when I decided to use this to find out my babies gender. The woman helping me seemed genuinely delighted to tell me, and it took all of the pressure off of me with friends and family wanting to be the first to know. I didn’t have to choose who would read the gender reveal to me. I wish this app could expand to include a social network. I think it would be huge if people were able to build a report together, and it wasn’t just at random. That way more visually impaired people would feel more confident using this service. Overall I love it",10/15/19 21:45,5
Be My Eyes,This app is absolutely amazing I got my first call two days after installing the app and I can honestly say that I was so emotional after my first call because I was able to help someone with something so little but it was so big to me.,10/24/22 10:57,5

Be My Eyes,This app is a great resource for folks that want to help out the Blind and Vision impaired. It took like 2 minutes to sign up and I had my first call the same day. I helped an elderly woman find a sandal her non service animal had taken. Thank You Be My Eyes for being an incredibly easy app to use and the fact that it's free is incredible because so many folks are on a limited or fixed income.

Seeing AI,"I see so many possibilities for this app. It’s very user friendly. My 5 year old nephew loved the People part and was taking pictures of everyone! When showing it to colleagues, they immediately planned on installing it for their elderly parents. Office Lens is a little more accurate for full document reading, but the short text works great! I often recommend it and use it myself, even though I’m not visually impaired. The development team is amazing and responsive to feedback. Way to go!",01/29/18 16:15,5

I used it for a few minutes and while it was able to detect correctly people jumping with a wakeboard (""seems like people flying in the air"") it was not able to detect a simple pizza slice on a plate, it thought it was a cat! Nonetheless, you are always able to teach the algorithm by snapping pictures of what you want and label it. Keep working hard on this guys!!",07/06/19 8:17,5

Be My Eyes,"Wonderful idea but for some technical glitch when I get a call it never rings so I don't understand when I get a call. Only when I open the app I get to hear a ringtone. It's not possible to always keep the App Page open. Also, sometimes even if it rang twice & I received the call it shows it's been attended by someone else. Please sort it out",10/17/21 22:50,1
Be My Eyes,Beautiful App. Probably the best idea ever since the invention of internet. So far I only got to answer one call and it made my day. Something so simple and so extremely useful. Thank you for making that happen. ❤,02/26/21 10:19,5

Be My Eyes,Awesome and such a great way to help... This is such an easy way for you to help your fellow people that need assistance with day to day things. The payback in knowing you were able to help someone by doing something because you have sight and they don't shows how we take things for granted some time. Do us all a favor and help out and volunteer 🙋‍♀️ 🙏 😉,07/29/20 21:02,5
Be My Eyes,Had my first volunteer opportunity. It was so incredibly easy to help someone.,09/25/22 15:17,5

Be My Eyes,"Just had a call 3 days after downloading, helped a man read the label on 
his shampoo bottle, the call worked perfectly and only took 10 seconds of 
my time to save someone else way more than 10 seconds of hassle. Left me 
with a positive feeling that I'd helped someone else, brilliant app 👍👍",06/23/18 11:01,5
Be My Eyes,"This seems to provide the enhanced self-esteem & overall rewarding feeling of altruism in the most facile, cursory manner possible. Just join the massive surplus of “volunteers;” receive a few  calls a year; if you try, possibly even be first to answer one. In that unlikely event, spend up to several minutes helping someone. Rarely if ever asked—never required—to  do anything, and still enjoy that good deed ego boost! Feel like a do-gooder all the time just for being “on call,” without having to take any given call. 

If that sounds like hyperbole, read through the reviews. Ask yourself, who is this app helping most– those with vision impairment, or those who want to feel like a good person without all the work?

It seems to me that a more efficient, formal setup could provide more than a free-for-all massive surplus volunteer approach. This would involve investment in setting up infrastructure like a vetting process; organized, predetermined shifts, during which the sighted user agrees to actually be on call; and some sort of incentive (maybe an accrued reward system like survey apps use) for those providing reliable, quality service. If that fundamental system were well-built to be scalable, the potential for what the service could accomplish is enormous.",06/20/24 4:04,3

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I used to love this app, it helped me cross streets in my community and was very unique. It felt like the developer had a passion for their work. However, now that the app has switched to a subscription only model (with no regard for legacy users) I will no longer be supporting it or recommending it to O&M professionals or other blind people. I'm very disappointed that the developer feels that this is the only way to make money, and that they choose to add a subscription to their existing app with no other benefit to subscribing besides getting to continue enjoying the previously free features. I hope the developer realizes most blind people have 0 extra income to use on continuous subscriptions, and that they have just alienated 95% of there users at minimum. I have lost all interest in this project and at a loss in regards to this decision by the dev.",01/08/25 0:07,1

NaviLens,"This app is pointless as you have to print your own labels. I don’t have a printer and, as I am totally blind, could not possibly know if the tags had been printed or not.

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I was initially very impressed with this app, which provided blind and visually impaired users with a safe way to cross streets independently. It was a groundbreaking tool that gave a sense of autonomy to a community that often faces significant mobility challenges. However, my enthusiasm has turned to disappointment with the recent introduction of a paywall and subscription model. This decision is deeply troubling, as it restricts access to a service that is vital for users who already face financial hardships. Many in this community have limited incomes, and making such an essential app unaffordable feels exploitative and unjust. It’s shocking and unacceptable that a tool designed to empower is now a source of exclusion. The developers should rethink their approach, as this paywall undermines the app’s purpose and alienates those it was meant to help.",01/10/25 11:20,1

Be My Eyes,I am very thankful for all of the volunteers to take their time to assist us blind individuals. I am disappointed in the fact that it takes sometimes a very long time to find a volunteer. I have friends that also are volunteers for the app and they said that the ringtone that they have is not very distinguished and that it is easy to miss a call. Therefore it should not be a beep butt and actual ringtone when searching for a volunteer. Other than this it is a fantastic app and does impact the lives of blind people all over the world.,02/20/19 13:29,4
Be My Eyes,"I love that I can help others in just a few minutes, when truly needed. We all have something we need help with, but it’s not always easy to ask or for others to be available. We might offer to help others but not really know what they need. This app reaches out to several people and they only answer when they are available. I’ve answered a few calls now and had others beat me to it a few times too. I look forward to the calls and hope those using it to seek help know that they are appreciated.

While it takes a little bit of learning to get good at scanning, once you get the hang of it, it's amazing how useful this app can be.  I use it primarily to identify cans in my pantry.  It's faster than putting labels on incoming stuff.  You get to know where the bar code is, how to old the can, and can have successful scans in a second or three.  The new extended information is great too.  For many things I scan, I can get ingredients and cooking instructions.

Be My Eyes,"Update after three years continuous use as a sighted helper:  the app has come a long way in development (wasn’t horrible at the beginning though) and is now very solid and refined.  Excellent software and network.

With 0.8 million sighted folks on the net at this writing expect anytime/all the time assistance if you are blind / VI, and an incoming call every few months if you are sighted.

Give it a try without hesitation.

——-(original review)——-

Been a sighted helper on the net for a couple years.  Current version has decent connection stability, very easy to take a call and render assistance when needed.  If I’m unavailable (driving, busy, etc.) the notification is distinct but NOT invasive, and it clears quickly without intervention.  Nearby folks will notice it but it’s unlikely you get harsh reactions if a call comes in at a bad time.

Due to the huge sighted : blind ratio of users on the net, incoming assist calls will be very infrequent.  If you get 10 a year, consider yourself lucky unless you sign up as fluent in multiple languages.

As a sighted helper, It’s EASY to do, FUN to help folks, and takes virtually ZERO time and effort.  As a blind user, know that there’s an army of “light dependent” folks eager and excited to lend a hand anytime and as often as you like.

This a great network.  One of the best applications of smartphone tech I’ve encountered.  Grab a copy and join in.",01/30/18 16:15,5

Be My Eyes,"Haven't used this app yet, but the idea is so awesome. I hope I get a call to help someone out. Hopefully this goes to the top of the reviews list, I doubt it. But Incase it does- I'm seeing people say it won't connect to calls, but I saw a review or 2 say to go into settings, go to 'be my eyes' app., Go to 'permissions' and UNCHECK where it says 'remove permissions if app isn't used', and that fixes the connection issues. If an app isn't used for a while your phone removes it's permissions.",01/01/22 2:02,5
Seeing AI,"A great app. Its a beta version but, its more then I expected. Maybe a feature recognizing objjects combined with the lidar technology would make the app perfect. I have some ideas I will provide. I give it a 4 but will give a 5 for the effort in such a short time.",04/18/22 13:09,5

Seeing Eye GPS,Works pretty good. There is no GPS that is exactly perfect every time. Some of the things that people are hoping for are not feasible and even some not possible. Google POIs are very crucial to this app and cooperation should happen in order to maintain them. The blind community has come to depend on this app for mobility independence and even safety. So let’s work together and find a way to make it happen.,05/28/18 22:12,4

Be My Eyes,Today I received my first call. I helped the nicest man pick out a suit and tie for a zoom meeting he was having. He was giving a speech for a contest. The excitement in his voice for the speech he was about to give and just making sure his outfit matched was absolutely incredible! His smile lit up the entire room. The appreciation and kindness he had for me filled me with so much joy it brought me to tears. Thank you Be My Eyes for bringing this experience into my life.,03/26/23 18:02,5

Be My Eyes,"The connection wasn't good at all. The person wanted me to check some information via google, but ended up hanging up because their connection kept breaking up.

Be My Eyes,"I’m grateful there is an app out there where those who are visually impaired can get help with tasks the rest of us take for granted. From helping change a thermostat temperature to pulling ground beef out of the freezer.

Be My Eyes,"If you like helping people and you’ve sometimes got free time in your day, download this app. 
From my experience as a volunteer, you will generally forget you have this app on your phone; notifications are infrequent and the app makes it clear that there’s never any pressure to answer if you’re busy.
But if you’re not busy and a notification pops up, you can help someone. From helping someone pick the right colour top for their outfit to getting the settings right on their washing machine so they don’t ruin their laundry, a two minute call can really make a huge difference to a stranger’s day. It’s a genuinely amazing use of technology, making the experience as easy as possible for both people involved. 
It doesn’t bombard you with ads, the settings are all very clear, and once every couple of months you can make a real difference to someone’s life without going anywhere to do so!",06/05/24 3:34,5

Wanna know the license plate number of the car in your driveway? This app does all of that quickly and easily.

Be My Eyes,"Issue with the calls. While the concept is great, I have received 4 calls so far and I was unable to answer any of them. The buttons on the screen were not working whatsoever! I really want to be able to help but it's pointless for me to keep this app if I can't use it :(",04/25/21 3:40,4
Be My Eyes,"Received first connected call today after a few unconnected calls previously due to app freezing. System worked really well this time and very straightforward. Supported the caller with request without any issue. They, hopefully, had a similar experience.",03/12/24 11:28,5
Be My Eyes,Makes me feel like I’m doing good in life and I’m contributing to society,09/04/20 11:56,5
Be My Eyes,"It was more than a year after I signed up before I got a call. The connection was flawless. The communication was extremely clear. I was asked to read who some mail was addressed to. And if there were any lights on in the house. I told him and he turned them off it went dark it was a great conversation. I am afraid to take calls now (but I will) my color blindness is becoming a real burden for me. I'm afraid I'm gonna be asked what color something is, particularly with articles of clothing.",11/20/21 21:39,5
Be My Eyes,The app is so easy to use and explains how to use it if you aren’t tech savvy. It’s also a very kind idea and is helping thousands of blind people around the world.,07/06/18 18:42,5
Be My Eyes,I have had this app for a couple of years and I have only had a couple of calls. The app works so well because the sighted members outnumber the blind many times over and you will rarely have a chance to actually help someone. This is not an app that you can polish your halo with.,10/11/23 23:52,5

Be My Eyes,"Everyone. Count your blessings.
Just now a tremendously rewarding experience, helping a blind woman locate individual fruit items on a paper plate, happened unexpectedly. I described the location of 5 strawberries (with stems cut off), one kiwi, and a pile of green stems using clock reference points (3 o’clock, 7 o’clock, etc). She was eternally grateful. How she accessed the BeMyEyes phone app is a mystery to me. But consider this: Our normal everyday agitations become fully insignificant when reminded of those daunting, crippling challenges faced by others every single day including today and each succeeding day into the future until the day they die.  BeMyEyes is truly incredible.",05/11/18 15:13,5

Seeing AI,"I just attempted to use this app for the first time, and I think it's quite good. As some have indicated, the document reader could use a little improvement, but many of the other features work rather well. I enjoyed the feature where you can scan a product via it's barcode. It would be nice if there were an option where you could scan a credit card to receive information on it, such as expiration date and the three digits on the back of the card. But overall, this app is wonderful. Thanks Microsoft!",07/22/17 12:48,4

There are a lot of volunteers signed up, and I truly hope that it’s helping the visually impaired community.",11/22/22 0:15,5
Be My Eyes,Highly recommend if you want to help out someone. It's an easy way to use one's full visual capabilities to good use.,10/04/19 9:06,5
Be My Eyes,"Love the idea behind this app. I think some people are dissatisfied with not being able to help more people, but there are way more volunteers than there are callers so there is a big gap between your calls, sometimes months at a time.

Be My Eyes,"I am a volunteer - I received a call for the first time today, and I answered, but it never connected with anyone. I wanted to try to find information, maybe I had done something wrong, or maybe I needed to report a bug, but I couldn't find any place to do either thing, either in the app or on the Be My Eyes website. Hopefully whoever called was answered by someone else and not just left hanging? (Still 4 stars because I'm not the one it needs to work for, I'm just a volunteer.)",04/02/20 11:59,4

Be My Eyes,"I’ve had this app for a long time but only hd my first call today. Its good to see there are millions more people helping than who need the help so someone will always be available. I helped describe a birthday card and told them who it was from but have taken one star off as the video quality made it very difficult to see the writing clearly, and so I was worried I wouldn’t be able to help.",09/07/24 5:22,4

Be My Eyes,This app is the great example about usage of advanced technology for greater good of people in need. Finally received the call today. Someone called me and asked me to verify if there is phone number written on paper he was holding or not. And if there was then read it out loud. I was feeling so much fortunate to be the eyes for someone and it literally fulfilled one of the purpose of my life. GOD BLESS THE DEVELOPERS OF THIS AWESOME APPLICATION.,04/02/22 8:14,5
BlindSquare,"This app is amazing. I bought it before moving back to Northwest Portland. I've been blind my entire life, and the one thing that often bugs me about cane travel is needing to keep the running mental narrative of what street I'm at. Everyone knows your mind wanders, you're thinking about something else, work, the kids, even just something you passed by. BlindTquare alleviates this problem. But, but, but, ... There's more!
I moved back into a neighborhood I'd lived in before. But one thing about being blind, you miss a lot just generally running around. I was amazed at what I found just turning on a couple of options, and having it tell me what I passed. BlindSquare is a great addition to the iOS ecosystem, and I for one am really impressed! I haven't tried turn by turn because I grew up on these streets and so I know the place, and the addressing system, like the back of my hand. Yet even for it to tell me bus, streetcar and train stops is amazing! I haven't lived here since before we had access to iOS, and now it's as though Portland just got a brand-new look, all because of BlindSquare and the iPhone!",11/16/13 17:31,5

Envision AI,I loved this program until they did their update yesterday. Now it refuses to stay open and crashes every time I try to open it. I have unloaded it from my phone and reloaded it with sadly the same result. It is incredibly frustrating as I am dependent upon this program to read the number on my continuous glucose meter sensor when I have to change them. Please fix whatever the problem is so that I can use it again. Thank you,07/26/21 12:24,3

Be My Eyes,I enrolled July 25 and answered my first call tonight by a sweet lady in Michigan it was 7pm Hawaiian time and she was up at around midnight looking at hallmark cards and needed help with them. While the camera was focusing we got to talking she found out I was an active duty soldier and then told me how her family also served in Hawaii. The call probably lasted about 10 minutes. It was an amazing experience to help someone and talk to someone new at the same time.,08/16/18 7:34,4

Be My Eyes,"First of all, I love this app. I’m only giving a one star review to get the developer’s attention because the video quality has been terrible for the last couple months (probably about 5 calls). It’s really difficult to help people read or decipher things when I can’t get a clear image. I’ve reported problems when asked after each call but haven’t seen any improvement yet so I wanted to note it in my review. I’ve still been able to help a little bit, but it’s been tricky. The video quality wasn’t as bad when I first started using the app so I’m assuming it’s a problem with the app and not my phone. For the record, I’m using an iPhone 8 and have good LTE and WiFi in my house where I get most of my calls. If this is something I can fix on my end, please let me know. Thanks!",04/28/18 22:55,1
Be My Eyes,"Of late, videos are getting very blurry, please fix this ASAP. Now, a significant lag is coming in the video feed.

Be My Eyes,"Just got another call. He's lucky I'm a computer guy also. Helped fix his computer and with some tasks. Found out he's from back home and works at a restaurant. Next time I'm home I'm going to hit him up. Update I think it's a great app, however I think the ""eyes"" should be able to put specific skill sets so if a task requires the helper to know what they're looking at it'll put the right person on the call.",05/03/21 2:12,5

Be My Eyes,I don't care about any tiny bugs in it. (Which is nothing. If Google /multi billion pound companies can get away with profits over people then this company made with less is still value for money put in. My first was a woman struggling at a train station. As a sighted person I understand the stress there and as it was my first call I may not have been the best at helping but I do hope this app makes the lady's day by being there for her in a dignified way.

Be My Eyes,"I'm totally blind and just used Be My Eyes successfully for the first time. I've tried it before but my Internet was never good enough. I have a different phone and carrier now, so I tried it again. My computer seemed frozen, and my screen reader wouldn't talk at all. I'm alone, so I installed Be My Eyes, called a volunteer and asked what it was doing. She confirmed that it was frozen and not responding at all, so I was able to restart it and get things going again. I had a wonderful experience using it and will definitely keep it installed! I'm glad so many volunteers are willing to help!",03/01/18 15:50,5
Be My Eyes,"Great to be able to help, amazing platform.",05/27/23 6:21,5
Be My Eyes,"Had a call once that i couldn't even answer, other than that it was just spam notifications of ""inspirational stories"" from the developers. then suddenly it wasn't installed anymore. Great idea. have no idea if it actually helps anyone.",04/26/19 21:26,1
Be My Eyes,"I’ve received countless notifications that someone needs help and I click on it straightaway and as soon as I get into the app, it says someone else has taken the call despite the fact I clicked on the notification as it popped up while I was on my phone.

As long as the people need help are getting it, that’s what’s important but I’m deleting it cause I don’t think there are plenty of people to help and don’t need this many users.",01/22/23 11:22,3
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for over a month. I got 1 call the first day, but I didn't catch it in time. I haven't gotten any since 😔 But I love the idea of the app ❤️",11/12/22 19:30,2
OneStep Reader,"I have not been able to get saved files to open and read and then close remaining unchanged.  It seems to modify everything I had saved if I open it to find out what it was.  There seems to be no way to close the file intact as it was without it being ""modified"" and changed in the date order, so that it is like a needle in the haystack to find again according to date it was first saved.  I don't want to modify what I saved by the simple act of opening it to read it.  It mostly doesn't seem to read a previously saved pdf that had obviously read easily in the past either. The OCR function which used to work rather straightforwardly like as in Kurzweil 1000, now is like a ""keepaway"" game.  It will only warn you that you can't change whatever it does to your saved image through this next attempt to get the app to recognize an image it once easily recognized.  Even if you don't choose to modify or save or even OCR what you've opened to just peek at with your ears like you could before, it becomes ""modified"" and it's search order is jumbled up as well as text that wasn't that jumbled before.  I never saved undecipherable files to begin with.  It is changing every file I open rendering it useless.  I used to be able to open it, and quickly find a file and use it on the street or in an appointment or meeting.  There's just no way to get that to happen now.  I've just spent hours here at home trying to sort out a way to use my files again, and it's just not working. I don't have hours to try to hope to retrieve anything on the go anymore.  I remember the first time I got the app maybe two December's ago how amazing and exciting it was to use in real time to read a menu, the first time out.  How I could find the first recipe I saved from a pdf!  I was so amazing.  It wasn't broken.  It didn't need to be fixed.  
It's like a trainwreck now.  It had been expensive but worth it, even with some limitations.  It has been hobbled! Makes me sad.",09/06/18 8:22,2
Lookout - Assisted vision,"Most options deserve 5 stars but the Documents option kills it. It is supposed to be a voice app yet the Documents option simply scans and OCRs the text but doesn't read it out. You have to use a separate screen reader app for that, which defeats the whole purpose. If one is silly enough to turn on the Accessibility/Screen Reader setting without realising what it does, it makes your phone unusable. The Text option can read out what it sees so why doesn't the Document option do so?",08/18/21 5:04,1

Be My Eyes,I have had nothing but positive experiences with this app! I love the opportunity to help those who need it. The app itself does a great job at prepping volunteers to take calls while also allowing the freedom for volunteers.,04/26/23 1:16,5
Be My Eyes,Too many volunteers. I’ve had the app 1 year and haven’t been able to help anyone cause they send you the same call they send everyone else. Don’t matter if it takes me .2 seconds to click accept. Someone else always gets it. And idk why I even have the app anymore,05/22/20 19:42,5

I have also found a couple of really nice restaurants that I didn’t even know existed just by playing with the app whilst sat down having a coffee.",03/12/18 2:03,5

Be My Eyes,This app is such a cool idea and fills a much needed gap. I just wish it would limit the amount of volunteers so there was a more equal ratio of volunteers to people needing help. Or perhaps introduce another way for all these volunteers to help so that we are being utilized more!,06/27/21 19:24,3

Seeing AI,"... useful for those of us with limited sight. Did some basic testing, and it’s not perfect, but what is? 😉

Wasn’t great with the colours, but I suspect that’s because the light was too bright from the phone, and it was bouncing-off reflections of that light, making darker colours appear brighter, or altering the colour detected completely.

For those of us with NO colour vision, this would likely cause issues, but I usually get family to help me when needed 👍.

The product ID worked on the 3 products I tested, it was flawless 😀.

The text/document test was ok, but as usual for these talking apps, I had to slow it down to make it more legible.

Overall, a very useful app, but needs work in some areas 😊👍.",02/20/18 8:56,4

Be My Eyes,Hi I am been active since more than 6 months. The purpose of creating this app is good and impressive. But I come across that one user is misusing this app and he himself has portrating as blind person. I know the case is negligible compared to the benefits received by number of persons . But my intension is that the objective of creating this app should not deviate or misuse.

Be My Eyes,A great idea and a brilliant execution!,11/19/20 13:51,5
Be My Eyes,I think many people enjoy helping so it’s a good way to help.  I’ve had maybe 5 calls in 2 years but only able to answer one of them fast enough and it was a person paying for a taxi verifying the correct payment amount.  You probably will only get a few calls and maybe be lucky enough to answer one or two because there’s WAY more volunteers than users but it seems like a great service for those with visual impairments.  If you have an iPhone you need to make sure it doesn’t offload the app to the cloud because you may only get a call like every few months so if you don’t use it iPhone will offload it to the cloud and you won’t get notifications when you have a call.  This is probably a comment for another forum but in general “Apple” needs to make an iOS fix to allow the user to designate certain apps (any app) to not ever go to the cloud due to inactivity.  Seems like this is kind of an obvious missing feature from the iPhone settings “Apple”… why don’t you go ahead and fix that for all of us mmmkay?,10/09/21 3:36,5

I absolutely love the fact that over 2 million people have volunteered on this app but I feel there is a large number of visually impaired individuals who do not know about the app. I strongly feel the creators of the app need to advertise on a larger scale or start branching out so the app can be more accessible to everyone who needs it.",08/07/19 15:06,5

Then after my first call I have o my had maybe 3 and I know there are other people on it. I just had one now went to open it saw a stove and it says someone else took the call. I could see the stove I was already connected to then. Other times the call will just drop. So there are some bugs that need to be worked out.",07/28/24 22:05,4

Be My Eyes,Love the idea of this app but there are some technical issues. I’m a volunteer and I received a call to help someone. However the video quality was very blurry and hard to help the person even though I had stable internet connection. Hopefully this issue can be fixed because it’s hard for volunteers to help a visually impaired person when the video quality isn’t the best.,09/26/24 0:59,3

I would love an option to allow vibrate notifications so I have a better chance of responding to a call.",06/17/21 14:13,4

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This is truly a great app, the ability to get another point of reference when crossing streets is really an amazing thing to have.
Not only that but the way the app is set up so that voiceover, Apples screenreader, can take full advantage of everything provided in the app is something I wish all developers could’ve done.
Unfortunately, that’s where the good ends, this app has switched over to a subscription based role model.
yes, I am aware that money needs to be made to continue further development. But also I am a student, who isn’t working, and it’s not fun to have to pay for an app that assists you in crossing streets.
The only suggestion I can offer, is if there’s a way to make a light version of this app. One that only lets you use the basic essential functions of pointing the phone across the street to indicate whether it’s possible to cross the street or not.
Thank you for making an amazing app, but unfortunately, the subscription model is what ruined it.",01/07/25 21:45,1

We have more than enough bad things going on this planet, BME has put together people who need each other. The visually impaired have always been at the forefront of people who I respect. It takes a person of strong fortitude and nerves of steel to be able to survive in this age of callousness. 

When I took my first call I wanted to make sure that I did it correctly. The gentleman that I assisted was so kind. My heart sank when the call ended because I felt that I did not do enough. Even the shortest call can make such a big impact on the lives of all involved. I will definitely be in for the long hall. This app should be #1 in the App Store.",06/09/18 22:47,5

Virtual navigation
The ability to create your own points of interest

It was a man who was showing signs from his hand held in front of back camera of phone. I thought that he was trying to say something but after that he he picked up another phone and unlocked it and went to the messages app and typed ""fu*k u"" .

Be My Eyes,I think this app is amazing and I love that it is free to use for those who need it! I can’t wait to be able to help someone.,02/19/22 3:30,5
OneStep Reader,"When the app works it's fine, but I'm disappointed  because it rarely gives a field of view report, no matter the lighting or position. Its great on other platforms, so it can be so here too.",03/19/16 5:54,4
Be My Eyes,Crowdsourcing a helping hand— just a brilliant concept. It’s so easy and takes minutes to be another person’s eyes as a volunteer. Very well organized and straightforward. TY Be My Eyes developers!,12/10/18 3:55,5

Envision AI,"I purchased this app a few months back after trying it for a month and really liked it. However, Within the past month, the changes made have made the app useless. It no longer  says what edges aren't visible so that I can move it in the correct direction to get the full image. Secondly, the text is now not viewable by flicking through the screen. You have to wait for it to read it, so getting instructions off a box for cooking is tedious. I didn't checkto see if it would read word by word, but who wants to do that when trying to  Prepare something?Thirdly, when I went to stop my auto payment, the options of subscriptions  are not read. I had to click on one of the unread items and then since I happened to click on the one I already subscribed too, it mentioned this fact and other info. I was then able to click the manage button and successfully unsubscribe. Until this app improves, I will not reccommend it to anyone. I was using IOS 12 last month and IOS 13 in the past few days, IOS isn't the  issue. I'm using an iphone 8 and have been for the past couple years. I hope you improve this app back to one that is as good or even better than the one I used when purchasing the subscription.",10/17/19 7:23,1

OneStep Reader,Since the name changed to OneStep Reader this app Is regularly changing my settings and overriding my choices of recognition language. On three occasions I have unselected all languages except English and told it which variant of English I wanted to use. On restarting the app and telling it the recognition language is English the app either selects and recognizes the English document as a non-English language or a variant of English other than the one I selected. Settings are changed.,02/23/22 14:02,2

Be My Eyes,"This app is truly an awesome way to help others who have visual impairments. Whether it’s helping someone pick out clothes for the day or read the mail, this app is all about helping others. It’s truly amazing that the developers care so much about this app and the group that are being supported by it. I’ve never seen an app show so much support for its volunteers. I would highly recommend downloading this app. And it might take days, weeks and even months before you are able to answer the call. But when you do, you really are helping someone. I just got my first call today after being on the app for more than 3 months, but even when I wasn’t answering phone calls, I still got updates from the app including articles and other people’s stories.",06/07/19 15:27,5

Be My Eyes,"I really thought this was a genius idea but I’ve been on here for months and I’ve not had one call or anything which is disheartening to say the least.
I would suggest investing in advertising & getting the word out there, bc as I said this is a brilliant idea, one that could expand once it’s becomes Viral, but it needs to go viral first! until then there’s too many helpers & not enough receivers so it’s many would delete the app thus defeating the objective. So in all, u need to get the word out & then this app could pop off.",10/07/19 10:31,3

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted person who worked for many years for a visually impaired person, I was thrilled when I learned of this app's existence. I immediately read up on it and then signed up. That was a few weeks ago, and I've since had the privilege of helping two users. While the connection has been a bit spotty on my two calls, it certainly didn't prevent us from getting the task at hand successfully completed. And to address another of the whiners' complaints, yes, you may indeed go for a couple or more weeks without getting a call. Here's the thing: that is not a problem. For heaven's sake, think this through. Isn't it a wonderful thing that there are so many potential helpers?!  Be My Eyes is a marvel and a godsend to those who need it. And it also has the happy bonus of being a way for those of us who like to help people to do so, easily and instantly and completely at our convenience. It's almost embarrassing how easy and convenient it is. So thank you, app creators. You've made the world a much better place for all of us, visually impaired and sighted alike.",02/07/15 23:04,5

My suggestion is that I want to say that when I talk to a volunteer, what did he tell me, if I forget that, then how will it happen, I will have to call again and again, that is why it would be good if it was recorded, then if some arrangement is made for that, it will be good, we will not have to call again and again, we can see at a specific place, what all did we talk about, what did he tell me about the product or about what I asked, thank you.",04/10/24 21:44,4

Be My Eyes,I love the concept of the app ! I’ve helped about two people so far since I’ve had the app but it’s very frustrating when you don’t make it easier for people to answer . I can’t even answer it on time because I have to unlock my phone & by the time I do that it’s being passed onto someone else which is a huge disappointment especially when you look forward to answering & helping others . So please fix that ! It should be easy to answer as if it were FaceTime or even Facebook FaceTime .,09/16/19 20:39,4
Be My Eyes,"I answered my first call today and it was such an amazing experience! IF YOU ARE NOT SIGNED UP, YOU NEED TO BE! You could help someone!",11/14/19 21:03,5

Be My Eyes,"This is an exceptional idea for an app. It's also well executed overall. 
The app works as advertised, and the selection of languages impressed me (I 
was pleasantly surprised to see even Esperanto included!). The only 
downside is the extreme rarity of receiving a call as a volunteer. It seems 
new volunteers often get a call within the first day - probably to keep 
them interested - but after that calls are few and far between. I received 
one call on my first day, but it was answered by another volunteer before I 
could get it. After that I received no calls for a couple weeks despite 
keeping the app running 24/7. Yesterday I finally received another call, 
which I answered. It seems much more promotion among the blind/vision 
impaired community is needed to help even out the numbers and so that even 
more people can be helped. Still, the app is an amazing resource for those 
who use it, and I'll keep it installed for those rare times when I may be 
available to assist quicker than anyone else. As someone who routinely 
relies on help from others due to health issues, it's nice to be able to 
help others once in awhile, too.",05/11/18 15:52,4
Seeing AI,Thank you Microsoft for creating this app keep up the good work to make this app even better,09/11/18 4:22,5

Be My Eyes,"I don’t even know how I heard about this app, maybe on television, but I just signed up yesterday and today, got my first call. What a wonderful experience! The woman who called needed help reading her prescriptions. We had a little difficulty getting her to hold the camera so I could see it, but we figured it out and she was so thankful. I just feel amazing that I was able to help someone and I wanted to share my experience that other people will sign up too. 
I love it!
Update: It seems that there are more volunteers than there are blind users. I’ve only had the one phone call to date and just wonder if there is a way to get this app out to those who need it.",11/27/18 18:48,5

You can't find anything on the internet that shows that it exists, and the address is a dentists office. 2345 Yale st. Palo Alto, CA. I'm not going to use it, and I don't think you guys should either.

I work 12 hour overnight shifts, so I'm actually awake at night and asleep during the day. The app states it automatically assigns a call accepting window to daytime only hours based on your timezone and there's no way to change it.

Be My Eyes,"I don't need more pressure. That's why this is perfect for me. I don't have to worry about not picking up if I am at work or just don't feel energetic enough to answer. The call just goes to the next person after a few rings. 

Also I don't get more requests than I can handle, since there are so many of us volunteering. Another thing that works for me is that when I do help it typically only takes a few minutes. 

Such an easy way to contribute. I would never be able to volunteer otherwise. Brilliant idea. 

Just having the app and knowing it's there makes me happy because this is the kind of spirit that makes the human world great. We need these reminders that our collective human spirit is expansive, imaginative, collaborative, and can be gently beautiful.",08/18/17 14:10,5

Be My Eyes,"They can’t regulate weather the volunteers discriminate or not, and I understand that. Still, as far as customer support goes, the emailed help I received from the founder themselves was super unprofessional, condescending and sarcastic. Also, volunteers have a huge lack of sensitivity training. Make some short videos or something about how to help people before just allowing them into the personal lives of others.

Be My Eyes,"I've only ever gotten one ring that someone else beat me to answering, but I have a friend with a brain tumor who is using the app to live as normally as possible without feeling like he's taking advantage of family and friends. It's a big relief to him.",10/12/18 9:20,5
Be My Eyes,I absolutely love doing this. As soon as I see a notification that someone needs help. I jump on it no matter what I’m doing,06/30/23 18:08,5
Seeing AI,I am blind but unfortunately I cannot use this app with VoiceOver. The app does not announce the tab names and buttons. Once it does something - for example opens a dialog “product was not found” — it’s impossible to close it — without asking for help from someone who can actually see. This defeats the whole purpose of this app.,09/09/22 3:38,1
Be My Eyes,this is the most helpful app  I have ever used as a legally blind individual.  Thank you for giving us the this gift.  Small daily problems like reading directions are the most frustrating thing.  Having these wonderful volunteers who take a moment of their time to let us not stress out over not knowing how to heat up my pot pie is actually a life saver.,11/17/17 11:03,5

Be My Eyes,"Excellent idea and so good for not just the caller but the volunteer too. In terms of feelings of fullfillment and usefulness etc certainly but also one of being connected to someone else in times of loneliness etc.. or just wanting to connect. I'm not suggesting people use the platform as a samaritans line but i guess were yet to see where it goes from here. Quite exciting. Especially waiting for my 1st call.

Be My Eyes,"Hello there. I have been using this app for a long time, and I love it. However, when I go to make a call, voiceover becomes very quiet as soon as I double tap “call first available helper “voiceover remains quiet until I go to the home screen. Before I go to the home screen, I have to literally put my phone up to my ear to hear what voiceover is saying. The audio of the volunteer is good, however. Please fix this bug. Thank you very much. Please keep up the good work. :-)",04/20/19 13:10,4

Easy to set up. Easy to use.  I had a call within the first month and was so happy to be able to help.

Out of the last 10 calls or so I had, I keep having this same issue on all of them. Please fix this, I know there are people who really need this app on a daily basis and these kinds of issues make it so unreliable for users.",03/08/23 7:31,2

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Recent update is HORRIBLE. The old version was really helpful with some fixable flaws. The new version is HORRIBLE and a huge downgrade. No consideration has been provided in making it easy for blind person to navigate the app. The old version had an easy to use and intuitive (and a ""talking"") interface. This has all been thrown away. What a disappointment! (Note to designers: Blindfold yourself and try to use the app. If this isn't easy to do-then you have failed!)

It's sometimes not the best for reading a very long document, but I can at least tell if my mail is junk or if I need to hold onto it. Moreover, the barcode reader is a nice touch. Its not the fastest thing ever to find that pesky UPC but you can do it. Overall this is highly recommended for most quick OCR and scanning uses.

Be My Eyes,"Someone recommended me this app. I thought about it for awhile, is my vision low enough to use this app? With my glasses I can okay. But when I misplaced my glasses, I can’t see to find them. So that is what I have used the app for. Not having to spend 20 minutes trying to “feel” for them has been great. 

I haven’t use this app much, because I try to always remember where I left my glasses. When mistakes happen , and I happen to misplace them I no longer feel bad. Thanks for creating this app.",12/31/19 6:03,5
Envision AI,"The app is great in many areas. However, I don’t recommend that users should purchase an annual or life time licence for now as it seems that the developer is still having issues with it. I have been contacting the developer regarding really fatal bugs and the slow responses and lack of clear answers to questions made me reconsider buying the life time licence and reflect on requesting a refund for the annual licence I have already purchased. I send emails to the developer and it takes almost 5 days to get a response. The updates have not addressed any of the bugs. Don’t buy at this stage, either you wait or buy monthly plans. For my wonder, the developer has recommended that I may use Android app instead to deal with the issues I am having with the app! Thanks all.",03/22/19 16:52,2

Be My Eyes,You got suspended because you use Be My Eyes to cross the street you ask the volunteers if you can cross now and that’s simply against our terms of agreement. It’s exactly too dangerous to ask volunteer who it not with you to tell you when it’s save to cross. You also speak very inappropriately rude to some volunteers.

Seeing AI,"The reason my rating is two stars is because it is super annoying to hear no edges visible top and right edge not visible left edge not visible bottom corner not visible bottom edge not visible and no edges visible

Maybe you could make it where it’ll say a little more to the right down up left right and then it would say move the phone away from the text and then eventually it would just say hold steady and take the picture
And when I hold my phone in front of text for short text it’s just reads about a quarter of the text and it makes no sense because it puts it in different orders and it makes no sense to me

And for my book reader when I hold it in front of the barcode it starts making big score faster and faster and then but it never takes the picture of the beeps just freeze and the app crash crashes
What I’m trying to say is when I hold the phone over a barcode the beeps just get faster but then when it’s about to take the picture of the beep slow down and then stop and the app restarts so please make these updates right away I mean right now",12/10/19 15:47,2
BlindSquare,"I first downloaded this in 2012 and used it somewhat, but found that it was clunky and to me, uncoordinated. It took a while of listening to demos and learning it's menu structure to come to the conclusion that it wasn't BlindSquare's fault, it was mine. Once I understood the layout and how everything all fit together like a puzzle, I basically stopped using any other GPS app and have used BlindSquare extensively ever since. Some apps update with what you'd think would be useful changes, but add nothing but bloat, BlindSquare isn't one of these thankfully. With every iteration of the app, the features and functions only improve, not get needlessly complex and useless.",06/05/14 9:18,5

Be My Eyes,This app is so helpful for me. The volunteers are so helpful and friendly. I recommend every blind or visually impaired person get this app. It’s helped me in so many ways.,02/25/21 4:13,5

Be My Eyes,Being able to help others is so wonderful and it’s so easy. I’m always humbled by a call and I’m glad to be apart of such a great app.,02/09/20 21:17,5
Seeing AI,Doesn’t read barcodes on my iPhone 14 pro. Poor effort,11/10/22 13:22,1
Be My Eyes,Why does it not work for me any more?  The opening screen doesn’t have a way to answer the call and I cannot find a way to do so!  Such a nuisance when all I want to do is be helpful. Why has it altered?,07/20/22 1:15,1
Be My Eyes,Feels awesome to help someone. And it’s super easy,04/24/23 11:17,5
Digit-Eyes,"This app if you know and have patients how to learn how to focus your camera and look for the barcode is very good. It can be difficult to use but not because of the app, more because of my not knowing where the barcode is.  I appreciate the beeping to let me know that I am close to the barcode.",05/22/16 5:42,4
Be My Eyes,What a brilliant concept. I love everything about this app. My only frustration is that I often can’t answer quickly enough before someone else answers but it’s still good to know the blind person got a speedy reply.,01/10/23 5:04,5
Be My Eyes,I got my first call after 2 days but the call didn't connect,01/31/20 6:55,3

Be My Eyes,"I have only received two assist calls. Both calls failed. First on connected two helpers. She stated I called her and she accepted the call. But I received a notice for assistance. Second one connected he asked for help with expiration date on a milk bottle but then the screen went black. I could hear him but had no image. 
The app has bugs. But I'll keep it to help when I can.",04/11/15 21:50,3
Be My Eyes,"I was told about the app by TIKTOK, I had never heard of it before and didn’t knew something like this existed. What a brilliant way to help someone!

Be My Eyes,"This app has a very good cause, one thing I would add are qualities, like if a volunteer is trained and experienced in a certain field he or she can help in that field professionally. It could also help you make friends with people who share your interests",01/03/20 3:35,4
NaviLens,"It's great. Tells you what's in your eats! Can't always read the packages, anymore!",10/28/23 6:43,5
Be My Eyes,This is a great app to help people. I’ve helped people with putting a channel on a tv and other things. So far so good. The only reason why I’m giving it three stars was because I just got a call from a women and went “Hello!” and the man next to her was very aggressive saying “Speak to her!! Comon ask how your day was and how your doing!” And obviously I was like woah but didn’t say a word. The service cut out and she ended the call. This app can be weird sometimes. The app is to help you see not to talk and ask how my day was.,11/27/21 21:58,3
Be My Eyes,"Update:never received a call again. Not sure if this app still functions I only received on call so far, but it was very meaningful to me to be able to help someone else. Thank you for creating this app.",09/06/18 14:53,5
Be My Eyes,I love the idea but ive nevergotten any calls even though ive had this app for a few months i wish there were less volunteers,04/20/19 15:41,3
Be My Eyes,I love the fact this app helps me connect to people who need my help and I can be an assistance to them.,06/02/21 14:20,5
Be My Eyes,Just be aware that you could get sexual harassed on this app.  At the end of my first call after I helped this older man read a letter he panned the camera down to his penis.  I’m a dude and I felt pretty violated...I can only image how a young girl would feel who was just trying to help somebody.  Just a warning...I’m sure the app helps a lot of people but I cant be on it anymore.,06/14/18 3:55,2
Envision AI,Pay monthly? No where does this app tell you that it is a pay monthly subscription until you log in and then it gives you a month free but still doesn't tell you how much it costs until you go into the app and search for it. Not good for the visually impaired.,10/30/19 17:28,1
Be My Eyes,I love being able to help someone. It's easy and fulling,02/19/21 17:07,5
Be My Eyes,This app is example how technology can make a huge difference to the quality of people life’s,01/19/20 5:18,5

Be My Eyes,Nice & great idea really,12/09/21 22:02,5

made me happy that I could help.",06/05/18 2:11,5

Be My Eyes,Phenomenal app-- life changing for the users and the volunteers.,04/28/20 14:38,5
Be My Eyes,What a great idea for an app! It makes it a very smooth process for users (at least from the volunteer end) and it is a very simple way to help someone. I got a call randomly one time and it only took a minute to help read a medicine label.,09/14/22 21:06,5
Be My Eyes,Brilliant idea and glad to be part of it! The servers have some lag connecting helper to requestor but assume that will improve later. Thanks,03/16/16 16:23,5
TapTapSee,I am blind I am running a Kyocera Event. I would really like the app to work on my phone but when I try to open it without fail every single time it says alert taptapsee has stopped working report okay as the two options. Please try to work on it and get back to me when you have figured some things out I'm running Android 4.0. I will rate it much higher if it starts to work right.,07/04/17 16:34,1
Be My Eyes,Genius idea to help visually impaired through video chat. It makes my whole week better when I get a chance to help someone.,09/16/20 19:25,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,"Tried this ""free"" app about a month ago and SS would not recognize anything but paper currency. There have been a couple of updates since then and decided to give SS A second try to see if it had improved any since the first time. However, it will not work now unless you pay. The least expensive option was about $60 per year at $4.99 Per month for a software which would not read a print letter that the actually free seeing AI app did actually read well. Do you know what they say, if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is… Time to hit delete.",06/03/20 1:30,1
Be My Eyes,It kept glitching up everytime I try to answer a call,04/28/23 11:27,1
Be My Eyes,This app is easy to use and it is an amazing way to use technology for good!! I’m grateful that I get to help people and stay safely at home!!!,07/21/20 3:54,5
Be My Eyes,Love being able to help others,06/20/22 1:21,5
Be My Eyes,This app is very useful for visually impaired people. I use this app often. I thank you. Thank you very much to your team for creating such an app for us visually impaired people.,12/28/23 10:19,5
Seeing AI,"historically I use this app daily and find it a fantastic help. However the latest version released one month ago has caused me a specific problem.
when the app completes processing (quickly) now reads The table  output bye columns top to bottom rather than rows left to right.
A bug? Or a specific change, either way let’s see if Microsoft can fix it",12/03/21 1:50,3
Envision AI,Tried to scan document with the app kept repeating over and over again that it could not scan the document messages became stuck constantly saying it cannot stand to document if the apps purpose is to read the document and it can't scan it Dennis obviously not working,07/13/22 12:27,1
Be My Eyes,"As someone who is an educator, being a part of this app and having the ability to help someone with a task even as a simple as reading instructions is so satisfactory. I’ve had calls where people just wanted company as they walked home. Nothing fills my heart more than being able to be a part of the Ne My Eyes volunteer group",04/09/23 17:02,5

Be My Eyes,"best app, looking forward to help people.",07/18/19 3:12,5
Be My Eyes,"I hope there will be more local language for the app not just in English. I 
can help you to translate your app language to my country official 
language. And I wish you can give more data about how many and the location 
of blind people based on location (gps) or based on member country so 
member can give help in emergency situation for the blind people. In my 
country Indonesia, very limited facility for blind people,I do have high 
hopes to this app maybe I can help blind people for free transportation in 
case I'm going to a place where the blind people also want to go there or 
have same direction as well. So because the app still have no further 
option to give help to blind people I give it 3 for now.",06/23/18 6:00,3
Be My Eyes,"This is a really fabulous idea for an app! I would really love to help out, so I downloaded. I've had the app for about a week now, and haven't gotten any calls.

Be My Eyes,Appreciating the brain behind this. I've answered 4 calls so far. But I couldn't help the persons who called me last two times since nothing was visible. It was clear for the first few seconds then it become totally dark with clear voice. He tried a lot as per my instructions but nothing happened. Please look into this issue and clear is ASAP.,12/24/17 8:41,5
Be My Eyes,Excellent tool for the community to help each other,02/17/23 13:48,5

Be My Eyes,This app is so great it makes me cry.,07/08/18 3:47,5
Be My Eyes,Thank you so much for building such a creative and thoughtful app to bridge seeing and blind people. I have received one call so far and the video interface worked well and the audio was clear. I have already shared the app with my friends in the hopes that they will also create an account and be on call for future “be my eyes” opportunities. I hope that the future holds more opportunities for people to come together to make the world more accessible. Thank you again!,05/07/21 23:49,5
Be My Eyes,I love that this app can assist the blind so the can accomplish small task in their daily life routines. Perfect!,09/25/22 6:36,5
Be My Eyes,"I can’t believe how many self entitled reviewers are giving this app a negative review because they “weren’t given enough time to answer” or never get to answer calls as if this is some game they’re not being picked to play in. If Someone else gets there faster than you, then that means someone who needed help got it quicker and that’s never a bad thing and it means the app is working as intended… with as little wait time as possible for the blind/visually impaired. This app works for those who need it and not for those who want to pat themselves on the back. I’ve had 3 interactions in 3 years and many calls where I wasn’t the one to be connected. If you really want to be available to help then it’s worth it to keep the app on your phone for that one time where maybe not many people are in a position to answer the call, but you are.",03/17/23 6:04,5

Be My Eyes,What an amazing app. We need more apps like this. Brilliant.,06/17/18 2:41,5
Envision AI,The app is okay however if you ever try to cancel the service you may have issues. I keep being charged for both a yearly and monthly subscription in spite of canceling them both and requesting a phone call where I explained the issue and was told that I would be refunded and no further charges would be attempted. Another charge was attempted so I'm attempting to reach back out to get this resolved.,08/30/21 23:44,2

Be My Eyes,"First, let me say that I think it's unfair to rate this app with one star because you haven't received a help call. It's quite obvious there are at minimum 10x more blind people then their are helpers. Be patient & feel honored to even be able to be a part of this.
  I think people abusing this app to make fun of people should be reported & banned. Helpers who truly have big hearts & want to be a part of something big, can't when cruel volunteers are getting calls. 
 This is a great concept & I can't wait to see this app grow & thrive.

Update 9/2016*** 
I have had a couple calls try and come through but I wasn't available for them. Today however my first call came through and I got to help a young woman by describing earrings to her. It was something small but felt huge to me. I've had this app downloaded for probably a year now. It's takes time.",09/07/16 13:52,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is a great example of the power of technology to actually improve the lives of anyone. This app focuses on blind or sight challenged folks in a clever way. I am not blind but it's just as important to me because it engaged me and makes me feel like part of a community every time I help out a blind person in need. Every interaction I've had on the app so far has been positive and I believe I was able to help the person on the other end. My only complaint is that I do not get enough notifications to help out but that's because there are already so many others ready to help which is a great thing. Next time you spend 20 minutes reading through a pointless Twitter storm rant or waste half a day on Facebook, remember that apps like this are the reason tech enthusiasts are so passionate about tech. I would love to see this concept expanded out to help anyone with needs.

BTW, my latest Be My Eyes call was some blind dude trying to pick out the best shirt to wear for an interview. I could help him by describing the shirts to him but then he started asking me for help on an entire matching outfit so I took the phone to my wife who helped me help him. Point is, we all need help from each other from time to time.",02/02/16 19:31,5

Very inspirational experience, very great service this app offers!!",12/28/17 18:46,5

Be My Eyes,"I’ve had this app for a year and have yet to successfully answer an incoming call. Either I accidentally swipe down when it’s supposed to be up, or left when it’s supposed to be right because there’s never an indication of what the right action should be. And since you only get a call about every 8 weeks it’s pretty hard to just remember.

Today I got a call and finally made it to a button to “answer”....pressed it frantically and nothing happened. Still couldn’t pick up a call. There’s a app message saying I need to enable my microphone and camera—- they clearly are for this app.

This is the first review of an app I’ve ever bothered to leave because I love the premise of this app and would love to be able to assist a blind person. However all this app has successfully done is ensure that I regularly hang up or decline a call from a blind person.",09/17/21 15:28,1
Be My Eyes,"I had no issues since this last review until now. Latest update on my Samsung now has notifications from be my eyes blocked in the app settings. It is grayed out and won't let me allow notifications. I'm so BUMMED! I LOVE the concept of this app. However, the last two times I got a call and went to answer it froze. Please fix it.

And yes, I did report the call.",01/20/20 22:13,2
Be My Eyes,Over the past year I’ve received about 6 calls from people needing assistance. I’ve helped people with things as simple as does this shirt match this skirt or what is the name on this perfume bottle. What a brilliant concept this is..it takes just a few minutes to help someone but the feeling you’re left with afterwards lasts a lot longer than that. 💗💗💗,03/29/18 14:05,5

Be My Eyes,"Amazing idea ! I hope every visin impaired person should be made aware of this , there more volunteers than users The company should start investing in radio ads instead <3",04/11/24 18:57,5
Be My Eyes,"Great app. let's us contribute in making the world little more accessible for the visually impaired. A great tool to increase the bonding between those who can see the world with their eyes and those who can not. A great way to bridge the divide and help create a collaborative world. Hope, people come out with more and more innovative apps like these to help those with challenges. Kudos and best luck..!!!",05/08/19 23:45,5
TapTapSee,I've had this app only a few minutes and I've been asked to rate it. So far I'm giving it five stars.,07/25/13 21:38,5
Be My Eyes,What a fun way to help someone and be able to give back! I get excited when I get a call. 🥰,09/08/22 17:45,5
OneStep Reader,"Some folks may regard this app as being too expensive, but I think it's worth every cent. Other OCR apps compare very poorly to KNFB. I recommend using this app with the Standscan Pro, results are just so much better than taking free-hand shots. Great job, keep it up!",02/29/16 5:53,5
Be My Eyes,"We have our phone in our hands sooo much now a days, might as well make yourself even more useful and help someone in need by just answering your phone and helping with what they need!!!!!!!! I have gotten two calls so far, and I cant even explain how full my heart felt when I was done!!!!!!! Please DOWNLOAD, IT IS SOOO WORTH IT!!!!!",04/11/19 3:27,5
Be My Eyes,This is a wonderful app. It's very simple to use and setup the account. I think it's a fantastic concept. However.... Most calls have a horrible connection making it difficult to provide or receive help.,09/02/22 15:15,5
OneStep Reader,This app works excellently as intended. Note: place documents on a stand like the Fopydo or stand the document upright before scanning to get the best results. KNFB needs to mention this to users in the app description.,02/28/17 18:41,1
Be My Eyes,Such an innovative app! It's also heartwarming to see how much people have volunteered. This is how we should continue to use technology help people in need.,01/03/21 6:22,5

Be My Eyes,Haven’t used the app yet but I’m excited to help out the blind any way I can,08/03/20 23:43,5
Seeing AI,This app is awesome and I as a totally blind person can appreciate what Microsoft is doing. But it is a battery killer. Still I was able to read a few weeks worth of mail and was able to reapply us to something that I had not even known we were removed from so good job Microsoft but there is definitely room for improvement.,07/12/17 12:10,3
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,"I like the app just fine when I was using my older Samsung Galaxy s10 but since switching to my s21 ultra running Android 14 and one UI 6 the app doesn't seem to run correctly it does not recalculate when I decide to take a different route veering off course slightly so I've had to now choose the Google maps option instead of the lazarillo option, also for some reason it does not allow me to save favorites.",03/07/24 14:24,3

Be My Eyes,"I am so happy that I came across this app. I have only answered a few calls but just knowing that I helped make someone’s day a little easier is such a rewarding feeling. I have a blind cousin so I know the hurdles they cross each and every day. God has blessed me in many ways, so helping others just seems like the right thing to do. Thank you Be My Eyes for letting me be a part of your wonderful app. Debra Baldwin Coffeyville, Kansas",01/19/22 19:01,5
BlindSquare,"I'm not sure what the point is to paying $39.99 for an app which no customer support exists.  The app is difficult to navigate and prompts many questions.  I contacted the developers prior to purchase and received NO RESPONSE.  I then tried contacting them via Twitter and received NO RESPONSE despite the fact they were active on Twitter.   Lack of response and non-existent customer service service is pretty useless, unprofessional and frustrating.",09/23/17 3:09,2
Be My Eyes,I received my first call today. I am so very humbled. It was a blessing to be a blessing and have the ability to help someone. I look forward to being able to assist again. I am grateful!❤️,11/08/20 16:38,5

Be My Eyes,it's not letting me sign up at all. tried all 3 methods.,07/02/19 17:14,1
Be My Eyes,"It would seem every time I’ve helped a visually impaired user they have brightened my day or given me a piece of joy that I’ve been able to carry with me after the call!  I find myself spending more time chatting with the user than identifying what they need!  Brilliant idea for an app, easy to use and a great service to all who use it!",03/07/18 18:06,5
OneStep Reader,EDIT:  Updated review rating as App now works on Android 9.,12/14/18 12:38,4
Be My Eyes,"It doesn't seem appropriate to give the app a bad rating because volunteers aren't getting calls. As of this writing, there are 24,000 blind users and over 300,000 volunteers: 12.5 times MORE volunteers than blind users. that's a wonderful thing. So be patient. It would be a shame if end users who could really benefit from this app are scared off by all the 1 stars that aren't really applicable to their experience.",12/16/15 1:03,5

Seeing AI,"I was excited to see the introduction of the app particularly for a family member. However it needs a bit of work. I found the app to be buggy. Specifically, each of the channels did not begin translation immediately. In fact, I had to re-launch the app multiple times before automatic translation would begin on the each channel. Also the app crashed several times in my less than one day of use.",07/13/17 9:15,2

Be My Eyes,No audio after received the call,05/23/22 10:51,1
Be My Eyes,"While the video will occasionally lag if the caller or receiver has a bad connection, it's about what you would expect from video conferencing. I love conversing with people from around the world, and the feeling I get when I can help someone. Only downside is it doesnt ring frequently ENOUGH! :-)",02/28/18 15:17,5

Be My Eyes,This is a very helpful app! More visually impaired folks must be made aware that it is out here just waiting for the opportunity to help them!!,06/02/19 19:57,5
Be My Eyes,"I got this app a while back but had not used it before today because some other sighted person answered the call faster than I did. Today I helped a blind someone read something and it was cool to help. You can even turn on the light on their phone if you need it to see better.
Because there are so many sighted people signed up, you don't get s call but once every few months.",09/07/17 19:34,5
Be My Eyes,One of the greatest ideas ever!,01/22/25 13:53,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the concept and the idea but the call hung up mid way. It does not allow you to press that it was not a good call only great. So how do we send ""feedback"" accordingly?",11/19/22 15:07,3

Be My Eyes,"Love the concept & would love to help but I had this installed for 6 mo. , nothing happened. I shared the app with around 100 people inc. those who are visually impaired. They never used it either. Consider advertising to those that need it. I know this may cost $$ & time but if you want this great concept to work, people have to use it. It'd be easy to email the States Schools for the Blind, Social Media groups for the blind, etc. Other reviewers had the same problem. I'll get a list if needed",12/12/19 22:17,1

Envision AI,Its a very good app and i regularly,11/28/22 9:48,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such an asset to visually impaired.  As someone who love to help people, it a rewarding experience to answer a call and assist someone.  I’ve distinguished black vs navy a few calls, looked to see if the pizza had been delivered and left on the porch during “no contact delivery”. Helped look for a sock to match its pair on the dresser,the floor,the drawer, the bed. Read a nutritional label. 
We all have our phones at our fingertips. Download the app. Be available for someone who needs it.  Be a good human!",04/30/22 18:12,5

Envision AI,"Just started using this. So far it’s going well. I do wish that I could find people in the explorer section instead of having to go from one to the other. That way, if I am with someone and get separated from them, it will not only tell me about my surroundings, but will also tell me when I come across that person.",11/04/23 18:46,4
Be My Eyes,I downloaded this app after seeing a video about it on Facebook. I got my first call the day after and was able to help someone choose a tie that matched their jacket. Such an awesome experience and very easy to use the app! I have recommended it to a bunch of people!,06/18/18 2:27,5
Be My Eyes,I’m seeing reviews of people giving one star to this app not because the app is flawed but because they don’t get a call within a month it literally warns you about that just wanted to give it some more good reviews and not a bad one,07/02/19 20:45,5
Be My Eyes,Before I receive cl .cl is getting cut. And I am getting sms as another person helped,10/24/17 20:30,4

Be My Eyes,Amazing idea and app.,11/09/20 9:32,5
Envision AI,Great! It can read my Yu-Gi-Oh cards inside the playing sleeves. Would've been 5 stars but as of Dec. 3rd it doesn't convert gallary files to text. I'm sitting at 4.5 stars since the color detector was added & I'll update my review once I've had a few days with the Dec. 4th update.,12/05/19 5:20,4
Be My Eyes,Had for about 3 years not 1 single call. Just takes up space on my phone for nothing 😧,09/15/19 20:49,1

TapTapSee,"I really love the app. It is great for distinguishing colors of things. It used to say what was on labels and now it doesn't seem to want to do that very well anymore. I do miss that aspect. However, I love it for telling me what colors things are. And it is definitely worth subscribing to as well.I would tell any blind person to get the app and let them know that it does help a lot for color detection, etc.",10/07/14 17:00,4
Be My Eyes,"I got my first call last week. It was a video chat with a man who got a new watch and needed to set it to speak instead of being read only. It took about twenty minutes because I had to Google the manual and walk him through it. When we finally got it working, he was so happy and excited. It felt so nice hearing the excitement in his voice. It's easy to help! Since there are so many volunteers, you won't be overloaded with calls. I've had it for a month but have only received two calls. Somebody else beat me to answering the first one, but I was able to get this one first. The calls ring on the phones of multiple volunteers and the first one to answer gets to take it, so no one is left hanging if you can't answer.",12/21/17 23:44,5

Be My Eyes,"I haven't had any calls yet, and I've had it for about two weeks now. And why isn't there a ""friends"" list, so a blind user can call their friends/favorites, and build trust like that? And there should be a bio page, where we can create voice recordings so they can hear us. I want to give it five stars, but it needs improvement.",02/23/15 5:42,2
TapTapSee,"I love this app, and I think it is 1 of the best apps that are on the Appstore that are actually worth having.  THanks a lot for making this app.",08/08/13 18:01,5
Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer and I find it very grateful for having the golden opportunity to help someone who is visually impaired or blind with their everyday tasks................,05/23/24 18:42,5
OneStep Reader,"The ""braille"" support is not the best. voiceover only reads one word at a time per element, forcing the user to strictly rely on speech alone. The field of view reports do not work all the time. As a result, it is difficult to take photos of printed materials. There are better alternatives that do not cost a penny. Do not buy this app if you do not need to.",04/01/24 11:16,1
Be My Eyes,"New to the ""Be My Eyes"" app, so haven't received a call yet, but giving the 
concept five stars and then some! As a volunteer my only complaint, like 
many others listed, is that we cannot set our own call times. For instance, 
the app calls most people during the volunteer's daylight hours from 8 an 
to 9 pm...rather than the volunteer's ""awake and available"" hours. So for 
instance, if a blind user in the US needs assistance and in their own time 
zone it is 2:00 am in the morning...it would be considered the middle of 
the night for most volunteers in the US. So instead of a volunteer in the 
US getting a call, the call would be routed to volunteers on the other side 
of the world who would normally be awake in the ""daytime hours"". My 
problem, as a volunteer, is that I am a night person in the US. So calls 
may be routed to me during the day when I am sleeping and unavailable to 
respond. And calls from the other side of the world won't come to me when I 
am awake at night, because of the ""only call in day hours from 8 am to 9 
pm"" policy. So I may never get to respond to calls for help, but I am 
willing and able! I look forward to being of assistance. I can usually 
accept calls from 2:00 PM to 7:00 am Pacific Standard Time, and would love 
to be a voice in the night to help others! Just make the app able to allow 
users to set their own availability and then I'd give 10 stars if I could! 
Please add this option to the development of the app? The only other issue 
I can see a problem with is that a user is not supposed to put medical info 
or medication info out to a volunteer and volunteers are asked not to help 
with such. On the one hand....I can understand this, as that could be a 
serious liability for developers and volunteers to take on, if something 
were to go wrong. And there ARE actually bad people out there who could do 
harm to others in regards to medication taking. But on the other hand, if I 
were blind and taking medications I would certainly want to know that there 
was someone in the middle of the night that could help me with such....for 
instance, if I dropped my medications and needed help sorting them again, 
or if I needed help reading a prescription label for correct dosage or even 
to relabel it in Braille, or to read safety precautions on over the counter 
medications, to tell me if a medication was expired before taking it. So 
it's got it's good points and bad, there's no way around that really except 
to make the rule of not asking for help with such and not giving help on 
such, but that's unfortunate. Other than those two things.....what a GREAT 
service the inventer/developer has offered to world. Your generous heart is 
a rare kindness and I, for one, thank you for your foresight and altruism.

Envision AI,"I really do appreciate the hard work of the developers put into this app. It is similar to Seeing AI, but in my opinion this app does better on certain things then seeing AI, and seeing AI does things better then envision. InVision doesn't really tell me what's outside of a window. It does advertise this, but I pointed the camera outside of a window and it just says a blue and gray window, or something similar. Take a picture of my watch? A white watch. Take a picture of the TV with a movie playing? A greay television sitting on top of a desk. Not sure what the issue is on that one. I do like the extra feedback that I get, Such as the color of an item and whether it's sitting on a desk. I don't understand why login is required. I just Rihanna a free trial for 14 days and don't understand what the login is for.",07/22/20 9:44,3

Be My Eyes,Great app! I just wish I knew how many lives I’ve impacted through the app. Like a spot that says calls answered : blank,07/30/20 23:46,5
Be My Eyes,"The ""be my AI"" takes a picture and then describe what it sees. HOWEVER, it is a text description that is harder to see than what the visually impaired would be looking at. There is no option to have the text description read audible. Fix this and we'll go from one star to 5 stars.",08/09/24 13:59,1

Be My Eyes,"This is such a clever and wonderful and amazing app. It’s just what the world needs, people coming together to help one and  be others with no strings attached. It’s not about the likes or fame or money. The person who needs help will never even know your name unless you tell them. 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻😊😊😊",03/23/23 22:13,5
Be My Eyes,"Really interesting app, I think it’s a great application of technology. I had my first call today, and it was very fun. The only issue is that she accidentally ended the call early, after taking a few minutes to explain what she needed. There was no way to get back to the call, which was too bad. It might be nice to have a way to reconnect in case of accidentally hitting the end call section of the screen. I am guessing she had to request help again and start her explanation over",05/04/22 0:25,5
Envision AI,good app,05/10/19 0:51,5

I don’t get loads of requests and it takes a minute if your time to help someone. I would say give it a go! It really is nice to be nice 😊",03/22/19 0:25,5
Be My Eyes,"Although give only just downloaded the app and haven’t yet had a call I can already tell this app is a game changer, I’m so glad somebody has come up with such an incredible idea to help others and it’s so easy to use! All I can say is more people need to know about this especially the blind or visually impaired as I would like to think it would be a massive help to them! Especially besucase there’s about a million volunteers and only 75,000 blind or visually impaired! I really hope this becomes worldwide and a common app to be used by EVERYBODY. It’s just brilliant:)",05/20/18 2:07,5
OneStep Reader,"I have tested this on multiple documents with amazing accuracy.
Works great on 5C running 7.1.2. However not good on iPod 5 gen. on iOS 8. I think it's the fault of iOS 8, not the app!",09/18/14 18:36,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is so unique, and I absolutely love it. I’ve helped 2 people already, a little nervous due to the newness of it all, but I’m always happy to help!

Needs only one bit of improvement: I had no idea how to decline a call while I was busy with someone. Could the seeing eyes have a toggle for availability? Or maybe pass the call on to another seeing person if it gets declined by someone.

Thank you for this app! It’s so wholesome!",06/06/18 23:59,4
Be My Eyes,"Great concept, BUT it’s been months and I haven’t gotten one request. Is anyone actually being helped? Are you actually sending any of the requests out?",06/21/18 16:52,2

OneStep Reader,"I love this app. I have been waiting for this since this was a standalone portable scanner. this is finally with in my reach now as far as affordability.   It's the best $99 I've ever spent. sure, I had to budget a little bit. But that is quite alright considering that I can take it on the go and read things that I never could before.  At least not until I got home to put it under my scanner. this is going to make college handouts so much easier now. i'm telling every blind person I know that has an eye device about the app.",10/28/14 15:21,5

Be My Eyes,What a great concept. Worked brilliantly. Thanks for initiating this!,06/18/18 23:48,5
Be My Eyes,"Works great, had for about 2 months so far, only gotten 1 call... To be expected since you can see that the amount of volunteers outrank the blind by far...😋 For those complaining about getting calls at night, I did just read from another reviewer that you don't get calls from 9pm until 8am in your own time zone. Not sure if this is right or not... Also if you need to not get calls, you can just log out of the app until you are ready to take calls again.🙄 One thing I am curious about is as a fellow disabled person (not blind), how they keep people from deliberately giving answers that would be untrue or just be hurtful, as some people might find this funny...😠 Seems like that would be too easy for some to do.😐",09/08/18 9:01,5
Be My Eyes,Its a great idea I just wish there was a way we could specify what times we are unable to answer calls! I'm usually working Monday thru Wednesday and the weekend so cant always answer calls before 5:30pm!,07/06/19 10:16,3

Be My Eyes,"As soon as I had my app up and running, I received a call from a Be My Eyes user. I was nervous that I would make a mistake but it’s as simple as having any conversation via FaceTime or similar. The call took maybe 2 minutes total and I honestly felt really good about helping someone out. Not sure how many volunteers or users are active on the app, but hoping to get more calls soon! Rated four stars because no other calls have come in that I’ve been aware of. Otherwise, it’s a five star app.",04/16/23 1:52,4
Be My Eyes,"I have had the app for a solid month but haven’t gotten a single call and the one time I did was 2 days ago and I got maybe 3 seconds to try and unlock my phone, open the app, and answer before it was passed on and was disappointed.

I haven’t gotten a call since but i understand that there are a lot of people that are on the app ready to answer but feel that there is to little time to answer.",06/02/22 18:47,4

However, the ease of answering a call is something that they need to really work on. most of the time I find myself scrambling to try to figure out what to do next. I’m trying to unlock my phone, and I’m trying to figure out how to activate the app. The writers of the software need to come up with a vastly different approach to answering the call. several times when it’s called, I haven’t been able to get to it in time, and that’s with the phone in my hand. it could resemble how you answer a phone call, with a simple slider to activate your phone and take the call.",05/26/24 13:58,3

Figuring out where exactly the barcode is on items to scan them in the first place is the hardest part but does get easier with practice/experience. The more advanced functions of the app are optional, but it only gets more and more useful the more you dive in. Definetly read the website's tips to get all the use out of it.",06/23/15 19:10,4

I can use Document for obvious stuff, and the Product for re organizing my kitchen cabinet & putting away GROCERIES—It isn’t as up to date as an I.D. Mate, but it isn’t $1200 either!!
I even use it to see if I get the TV on when I get lost in the TV vs. Cable-box or Apple TV fight.  I EVEN use it to see if I have any BIOS POST errors, or to see if Windows is UPDATING or such when my PCs take forever to BOOT!

Be My Eyes,Only got one call so fast in the couple years having it but there’s way more volunteers than there is blind so I love that even though I can’t help as much as I’d like to. Such an amazing app!!,11/04/23 2:46,5
Be My Eyes,This app brings the peace to my soul by helping whom needs help while you can ..... Thanks for letting us sharing our blessings with others.,10/23/19 15:04,5
Be My Eyes,"I used Be My Eyes for the first time today as I am colorblind and unable to determine color differences well. The volunteer was connected to me almost immediately, and helped me sort my tomatoes so I can make sauce tonight. Thank you Be My Eyes!",05/31/24 17:46,5

Be My Eyes,what a brilliant application!,01/22/19 20:45,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is such a great idea! Calls are typically few and far between but I always look forward to answering calls, as it elicits the same excitement level as receiving a call from Santa. Also knowing you are helping someone in the simplest yet fulfilling way is an easy way to perform a good deed of the day. Mahalo, Be My Eyes, for utilizing smart phones in an ingenious manner.",09/24/19 5:56,5
Be My Eyes,This is such a great volunteer activity! It feels great to help and people are so appreciative. It's also really easy and convenient to take a quick call whenever it fits in your day.,01/15/24 10:52,5
Be My Eyes,"Had it for over a month. Zero calls. Zero alerts that I was receiving a call. I even set my primary language to a different language and my secondary language to English. Nothing. You cannot designate your own availability hours, so those of us with second or third shift jobs can’t even offer availability during the night.",06/14/22 21:41,1
Be My Eyes,"This is absolutely one of my favorite apps.  Had it not quite a year. I’ve answered 4 calls, helped each person, they are so thankful for the help and I am so thankful that I can help.  The best feeling in the world, knowing just a minute of my time helps them with whatever task they are doing.  I have told and will continue to tell everyone about this service, so they can sign up and be helpful as well",11/03/22 7:43,5
Be My Eyes,Every call is different. Love helping and meeting new people from all over the world.,03/08/18 4:32,5
Envision AI,"Thank you so much for making this app free for everyone. You understand the situation of economic backward sections. This app provides enormous benefits to visually impaired and their educational and professional life. In this version, slide improvements should be brought as it is taking a little longer to recognise the text in photo or document has compared to the previous versions. Thank you.",07/26/22 22:40,5
Be My Eyes,Ir feels nice to help the blind it is a very good thing what your doing.,02/26/20 13:47,5
Be My Eyes,Brilliant Idea..Thanks,05/23/21 6:53,5
Be My Eyes,"I've taken several calls, ranging from someone asking what type of food item was in a gift basket to what color jewelry they had inherited from a large estate. It's always something new. Many calls take less than a minute but I actually like the longer calls. I have a vision issue myself, but want to stay on the volunteer side for as long as I can, knowing that I will eventually transition to having to use the services. Thank you for creating this. It's a wonderful service and a fun volunteer activity. I actually wish I would get cars more often. 😀",03/05/23 3:31,5
Be My Eyes,No phishing,04/05/20 22:58,5
Be My Eyes,I volunteer and this app is amazing. This app is basically sharing kindness and I love that.,09/19/21 17:55,5
Be My Eyes,"I wish I got more calls. It's such a joy to help someone. There are a lot more volunteers than users though. Very simple to use on the sighted side, can't attest on the other.",01/14/25 18:08,5
TapTapSee,Thank you for making an app that is so simple. There are other object recognition apps out there but I think this one is the best so far.,01/24/13 9:08,5
Be My Eyes,Needs an account before you can even do something,05/04/21 23:56,3
Be My Eyes,"Brilliant. Just helped my first caller read some labels. She was very polite, pleased to have helped.",12/29/17 7:55,5

Be My Eyes,I helped a nice lady cook rice! It was a really touching experience!,11/04/19 1:08,5
Be My Eyes,Answered a call for the first time and I know I was helping the gentleman calling but man did this actually help me. The power of helping others is such a joy and so beautiful.,09/16/21 4:06,5
Be My Eyes,This app is very helpful to blind people. You can get help at any time of the day wherever you are. The volunteers are very helpful and patient. I recommend this service to all blind people. Thanks,05/07/24 14:42,5
Be My Eyes,"I tried this app when it first came out but despite giving it on my phone for months, I never received a call. 

I thought I would try again with technology moving on but the same thing again. I’ll probably leave it  on until the end of the rest, and if no calls come will delete.",11/05/23 6:47,1
Seeing AI,"The reason my rating is two stars is because it is super annoying to hear no edges visible top and right edge not visible left edge not visible bottom corner not visible bottom edge not visible and no edges visible

Maybe you could make it where it’ll say a little more to the right down up left right and then it would say move the phone away from the text and then eventually it would just say hold steady and take the picture
And when I hold my phone in front of text for short text it’s just reads about a quarter of the text and it makes no sense because it puts it in different orders and it makes no sense to me

And for my book reader when I hold it in front of the barcode it starts making big score faster and faster and then but it never takes the picture of the beeps just freeze and the app crash crashes
What I’m trying to say is when I hold the phone over a barcode the beeps just get faster but then when it’s about to take the picture of the beep slow down and then stop and the app restarts so please make these updates right away I mean right now",12/10/19 23:47,2
Be My Eyes,"So far, so good. It may sit idle on phone for a while but when someone does call...it feels so nice to be able to help someone. Hope to receive more calls soon.",01/26/23 16:10,5
Be My Eyes,it’s amazing and it feels great to pay it forward with someone that needs the help.,06/04/18 23:05,5
Be My Eyes,I’ve had the app for a year!,07/13/20 3:50,5
Be My Eyes,"I think this is app is a wonderful idea, and the fact that thousands of people around the world band together to help visually impaired people with everyday tasks is absolutely amazing. 10/10",07/05/19 2:10,5
Be My Eyes,Had my first call. Wish I received more calls!,09/23/19 23:24,5
Be My Eyes,"I have received 2 calls and the first time my phone didn’t even ring, just a missed notification and the second time as soon as I answered it went to the main screen again so I’m not sure about the functionality of the app",08/04/22 17:01,3

Be My Eyes,Firebase Google OAuth,10/18/22 2:02,5
Seeing AI,"I have an iPhone 7 and have the most up-to-date iOS. I find this app to be more of a pain in the butt to try to get it to function than it is helpful. I just spent 15 minutes attempting to find out what this box of medication is, and I am still without an answer. This is not the only example of the trouble I regularly have with this app; it is just The most recent incident.
 I don’t know if other users who’ve written reviews are paid by Microsoft or are using non-Apple products with the app, but I find it to be far more of a hassle than the TapTapSee app, which is still pretty darn sucky.",08/04/19 20:55,1
TapTapSee,I use it to identify money and household items.  It works very well.,07/16/13 13:14,5
Be My Eyes,I recently help someone on the app and it went every well. I highly recommended this app!!!,07/10/18 0:41,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,"Supersense is a great all in one tool for accessing many features in one app. My phone screen is scattered with various blindness apps to help me do something or another. An app for reading money, an app for just quickly reading something I found, another app for quickly importing and reading a picture from the share sheet, ETC. this app is nice in the sense that it combines these all together limiting my array of apps I juggle around on a daily bases. 
Probably my favorite and most used feature is how the scanned text is displayed. Instead of your traditional screen where it just reads you the hole page of text, and you have to switch to line navigation or something similar if you want to read individual parts. They break the text into blocks, and it is super fluent to read the exact parts you need. Not only that, but you can copy these blocks of text easily to your clipboard via the roader.
Now, one thing I see people are concerned about is the price. It is subscription based. You can purchase a monthly, yearly, or a lifetime subscription. I don’t have much else to say on that, other than if you are worried about the price, you can download and try it out for free. Also, if you maybe don’t have the money to afford the app, at the bottom of the subscription signup page, you will find the following message.
“You may qualify for a reimbursement for your subscription from a state organization. Tap to request assistance and we will reach out to you with additional information.”
I am not exactly sure who all that would apply to, but it sounds like they are willing to work with you to get you any help you need. I think that is really great of them, and speaks very highly of them as a company.",10/16/20 17:35,5
Be My Eyes,"Great concept, besides the things other reviewers have brought up it really needs an active hours feature. I can't help anyone for at least 5 hours a day because of my job, and it's upsetting knowing I can't help people at the moment when I'd be more than happy to when I actually have free time.",10/27/22 20:08,2

Be My Eyes,This app is SUCH an unbelievably good idea... whoever came up with this has a heart of solid gold. I can't wait to get my 1st call!!,09/20/24 4:59,5
Be My Eyes,"I’m a volunteer here, and I have had the opportunity to help one of the members. She needed assistance with the instructions on a package of prepared food. A small task, sure, but one that I suspect is very frustrating for many people without sight or with limited sight. The Be My Eyes interface was intuitive and the communication was smooth. It made it very easy for me to assist this young woman and perform my mitzvah for the day. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity.",10/01/18 15:37,5
Be My Eyes,I love just having this app on my phone. Knowing at any moment I might get a chance to help someone. Thank you to the creators!,12/29/23 3:48,5
Envision AI,It is very useful for us thank you your kind help,07/25/22 8:23,4

Be My Eyes,"I am a volunteer. I was playing music from my phone when someone called and 
when I answered I turned the music off. The thing is every time I opened 
the Be My Eyes app, the music would come back on. I am not sure what 
happened and the person had to disconnect. I hope they found the help they 
needed. I also wish that hadn't happened. Do y'all have any advice to 
prevent that from happening?",07/24/18 7:09,2
Seeing AI,Everything is good in this application but the new feature that it has come with describe videos is not working for me my experience with it is a bit bad today.,11/03/24 2:07,5
OneStep Reader,"Over  the years, I have  used character recognition apps on various platforms. This by far is the best. It's fast and accurate. The field of view report is a well worth addition to ensure that one gets the full-page view of the camera. I have tried everything from brochures to mail two bottles two boxes and all kinds of things. It has been amazing to have this access to the printed word.",10/04/14 6:16,5

Be My Eyes,This app is a great one. I had to wait a pretty long while before I got my first call and I have since answered two calls after then. The feeling I get after helping a visually impaired person is incomparable. Thanks for the app and keep working on making it better!,12/03/21 2:09,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"I've been using this app for quite some time now and really liked it, but I was just thinking how great it would be if somehow through this app you could link up a pair of smart glasses to it instead of having to pull out your phone and pointed at something every time you wanted to use it it would be so much better if you could just have a pair of those many types of smart glasses with a camera and Bluetooth speaker built in it would be so amazing to be able to use all the features hands-free.",01/01/24 16:08,4
Be My Eyes,Why Cant I set a time up for when people call through. My phone was getting a call from the app at 3 in the morning and to be honest I don't want to be woken up even if it is to help someone. Let someone else who is awake answer the call. Anyway I need to put settings on this I can't see how and don't want to be woken up in the middle of night. Thanks great idea though,10/05/19 3:17,2

Be My Eyes,"I’m not technically savvy 
Yet this App is so simple and user friendly 
To be of service aiding others with Big & little daily tasks, is a Gift to all involved.

“Sometimes the greatest contribution we can make is to allow others to contribute to us”  
I weep with joy when I read the stories 
This is the kind of world ( Community) I hope to age into. 
Cooperation vs competition",11/06/19 7:25,5
Be My Eyes,"I was amazed to find such an app and upon downloading was thrilled to see such a community thriving.  I decided to become a user.  While I have not used the app for my own sake I do know I will need it in the future.

Upon listening to the testimonies of users and volunteers helping people with various everyday tasks from picking out wardrobe, makeup, to computer issues and setting up household items like a TV or having a picture described in a museum.  Such stories were inspiring to me and I was moved to volunteer.  

This is where my rating finds itself at three stars.  I’ve become indifferent to the app altogether.  I want to use the app.  But at the moment I want to volunteer.  Had I known I only had one option upon creating an account I would have signed up to help my brothers and sisters in darkness shine a light into their world.  Because I am not allowed such freedom I have given the app this rating.  

I know as a user I will need assistance eventually as my vision gets worse.  Until such an alternative is given for volunteers and users I will leave my rating as such.",10/02/19 16:29,3

No response. This feels like they have taken my money and run. After 6 weeks, with pressure from BBB and Google Play support, knfb notified me of an updated version, which I tried.

Be My Eyes,"I have been using this app since 2018 and have been given the opportunity many times to assist someone with every day tasks. I have helped with everything from reading postcards and letters from loved ones, describing family photos, helping to dress for interviews, sorting canned goods by expiration dates, picking out groceries in the store, sorting Valentine’s chocolates (she didn’t like the dark chocolate lol) and helping to sort laundry by colors for washing. It’s such a blessing and the people who I have had the chance to interact with are always so friendly and appreciative- I have NEVER had a bad experience on this app!  ❤️. Even though you may only get a few calls per year, it’s such a cool opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life and to have a positive human interaction.

Seeing AI,"My brother is blind and has been living independently for a few years now. Occasionally I'll head over and get a few questions -- maybe which flavor of a product is which. Maybe he received a few dollars back and he didn't know which was the 5 and which was the 1.

Seeing AI,"Overall this is the most useful app on my phone. However, I'm getting sick of the occasional reset of settings between launches. EG. I'll have my channels ordered and everything set the way I want and scan some mail, money etc.
A few days later I need to scan one simple thing and I'm forced to bypass/skip the little introduction to Seeing AI thing. When i'm in a hurry and having to faff about with things I already did, I consider uninstalling this app and just looking elsewhere. I understand this is free, and how we should all be grateful. But this is a longstanding issue and I'm tired of the reset btn being pressed in Seeing AI configuration so I have to set everything up again. Oh, and that includes the annoying tutorial popups for each mode. As if I haven't used this app for 7 years regularly now. Please please address this and soon. There's probably more people out there experiencing this random reset behavior and too nice to be critical of a free app.
Other than that, one of the best recognition apps and I've tried them all.",04/12/25 5:45,4

BlindSquare,"Fantastic!!!! its almost a luxury for a blind person to know the name and rough distance to the next intersection and some pois. I have yet to try it in an unfamiliar environment however, its performed well testing it randomly in surroundings i already know. Just put your phone in your pocket and walk round the block. I must stress, it cannot replace mobility aids,  nevertheless, Blindsquare has much potential.  Other features include, a look around button giving direction of road crossing or poi, shake to give current location and a very handy radius adjuster which gives more info if distance around you is increased.  I havnt discovered its full capability  as i have only had it a few days.  It gets  full marks for being so reasonably priced as usually anything that is This good and so vital for the blind costs the earth.",10/05/12 9:21,5

Seeing AI,"Very infrequently does an app come along which can have a real impact on improving the day-to-day lives of visually impaired people, many have tried and often don’t succeed.

Since it’s first launch in the UK Seeing AI has become a permanent fixture on my home screen for the main reason that it is helpful. As a visually impaired person, simple tasks such as reading product labels atop shelves In a large store can become both a complicated and embarrassing experience; however, with Seeing AI’s short text channel it becomes much easier to independently find what I’m looking for. Meanwhile, the document channel can be very useful if there is a printed page to read, I have found a relative consistency in the accuracy of the scanning and for standard printed documents it has proved to be very accurate on many occasions. Version 2 has also brought a number of enhancements such as multiple currency recognition and colour detection, which could be really useful for some people.

As of right now, Seeing AI isn’t ‘perfect’ as there are still some enhancements and needed improvements concerning factors especially regarding the ability to read different types of text, such as on a destination display board or picking out information with busy documents such as a restaurant Menu. However, Seeing AI has a great team of committed people behind them and have already made significant usability enhancements such as the use of 3D Touch on newer iPhone models to quickly reach a desired channel quickly.

Overall, for anyone who has a visual impairment Seeing AI is more than just a worthwhile download. It is a genuinely useful mobility aid, which in some cases is able to allow more tasks to be undertaken independently. Whilst there are still some improvements and enhancements which can be made to improve the experience, for the price of nothing there is no reason not to give Seeing AI a chance.",01/15/18 4:53,5

Be My Eyes,"This app has opened my imagination in so many different positive ways. I lost my vision at the age of eight years old, and I’ve been blind for 31 years. Finally, this has made a true tremendous change with be my AI that describes things with so much details that I am impressed, and thrilled to know that this app has helped me and will help so many other individuals like me. Thank you Be My Eyes for making this app even better.",12/09/23 1:47,5
Be My Eyes,"Fantastic idea, truly amazed by whoever got this running, makes one's heart warm to be able to genuinely help somebody in need.",12/10/17 5:05,5
Be My Eyes,"Great idea. I look forward to the AI version being available. But why is there no dark mode for the UI. I'm photophobic and the abrasive bright white UI is unusable for me. It's seems unfathomable to me that an app for the visually impaired doesn't offer a dark mode UI option, or better yet, automatically detect the system wide UI choice of dark mode and adjust to match that.",12/04/23 10:32,4
Be My Eyes,"This app is super easy to use and a great way to help others from wherever you are. There are a ton of volunteers on the app so it’s not very often that I get the pleasure of answering a call, but when I do get one it’s very rewarding! Thank you for creating such a useful app.",12/17/20 17:42,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this app. I rarely get calls but I have been lucky enough to answer a few in the past few years. Although I get so upset when I miss a call (because it’s exciting to answer and be able to help when I can), it makes me happy that I don’t get them so often! It just means that there are that many other people who are available and willing to help.",04/17/20 22:40,5

Be My Eyes,"Everyone should hear about this app, I think it’s really making a difference",12/28/18 10:43,5
Be My Eyes,"I have had the opportunity to answer a call twice. The first time I was helping a gentleman with a clock. I caught myself saying “.do you see this button” and of course quickly realize how dumb I sounded and needed to find other ways to describe like “there’s a button on the left of it, try to feel for it…”. He was very appreciative and didn’t seem frustrated by my “do you see” comments. The second time was a woman going out for the evening and had some top laid out on the bed to match her pants. This time I was sure to be careful with my choice of words. We had a lovely chat and I helped her pick her outfit. Both times only took maybe 10 minutes and I’m sure I got more out of it then the folks I helped did. Both times when I hung up, I gave thanks for the health of my eyes, something most of us take for granted daily. Way to go Be My Eyes! Lucie H.",01/02/24 3:46,5
Be My Eyes,"A really superb idea and app. About one week after registration, I received a call and was able to help someone.",02/09/23 0:15,5
Be My Eyes,I absolutely LOVE this app. So glad to be able to help folks and lend them my vision for whatever they need. THIS is what technology should be used for <3,06/24/19 22:15,5
