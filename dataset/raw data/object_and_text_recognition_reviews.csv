I am noticing the smoothness of the speech at line breaks is a little long, the numbers under a barcode are read as a full number at first but then as individual numbers, there's nothing to let you know how a found item will signal with the beep before it happens, the ai description is accurate.

Envision AI,"🚨 As of Nov 2024, the AI has deteriorated; very rude, inaccurate & unhelpful! With Meta's new VR glasses which is much more useful, & cost just US$299, everything EnvisionAi tries to sell is obsolete, useless & grossly overpriced at over 10 times! ChatGPT recommended Envision AI to me back in 2023. The dev need to do soul searching, as to how they were at the front-front of AI technology, but is now now a pale shadow & bad joke. A cautionary tale when a tech company puts profits over people!",2024-11-01 15:37:39

Envision AI,"Why does it expect a blind person to read the descriptions it makes of faces and scenes? If I could read without extra support I wouldn't be using a device for the blind. How do I get it to talk to me? Occasionally it barks out words, but inconsistently. I am so frustrated - and very confused. I hope there's a work around, but shouldn't the reader come as standard, rather than text in app? What's going on? Whats the point of an app for the blind that you need sighted companions to read?",2024-08-29 14:02:18

Envision AI,"The Envision app is definately by far the best app for the blind and visually impaired on the market today. It far surpasses all of the other apps for android due to the fact that it is so easy to use, and gives you auditory guidance when lining up the text for reading and so on. As a user of the app myself, I have come to realize just how useful it can really be in so many situations. At the time of this writing, I am on the free trial version of the app, but I can definitely tell you that this app will bring a level of independence that no other app on the market can bring you. For one thing, the accuracy of the scanning of the text is far superior than any other app. The folks at Envision have really thought of everything! Being blind or visually impaired doesn't have to be a prison any longer. Technology has come to the rescue with Envision, a brand new innovation in wearable and handheld technology that uses artificial intelligence to help the blind and visually impaired to navigate in a sighted world. Now for the first time in history, artificial intelligence is able to help the blind and visually impaired get more information from a sighted world by implementing the reading of text based information in real time, or by taking photos and relaying the information through optical character recognition technology that is second to none in the industry. Not only this, but Envision technology can do so much more. You can use it to describe your surroundings, tell you what color something is, identify faces and even read bar codes and identify certain objects. This means that Envision AI technology can actually learn thus making it the one and only technology for the blind and visually impaired that is fully customizable for each person's individual needs. You see, more and more companies are jumping onto the bandwagon by creating their own wearables and such that are designed to improve the lives of those who are sight impaired. However, Envision is the only company that takes it all a step further and really goes out of the way to research and implement new innovative technologies that other companies can only dream about adding to their products. This is because the people behind Envision are serious about their work, and they want to provide a product that not only works, but actually enriches the lives of the blind and visually impaired all around the world. So whether you have the app installed onto your phone, or you're using the new Envision glasses, you're sure to get as much information as possible about your surroundings and other things that you need on a daily basis that will help you work,learn or play. Envision's optical character recognition is far superior than many other apps and devices on the market today. You can read books, magazines and any text on any surface, even from television screens, computer screens and other digital displays. Envision is the only technology that encorporates real-time reading of text so that if you need to read house numbers, signs or anything else immediately, Envision AI can definitely handle it for you with no problem whatsoever. No other device or app can do this. So whether you're in school, working on the job, or whatever, Envision AI can do what you need it to do throughout your entire day without getting tired or giving up on you. You are able to read any printed text, and even some hand written text as well. The goal of Envision is to make blind or visually impaired people as independent as humanly possible without needing any assistance from a real human, but even if that's needed, you can still get human guidance because you can call someone and they're connected directly into the app, or into the glasses and they're seeing exactly what you see, so they can guid you around objects and such. Here again, no other device on the market can even do this. Envision AI is the only product that can provide this to the user. So as you can see, Envision AI is definitely hands down the winner here. It does far more than any other vision system on the market today.",2021-11-09 00:01:49

There are plenty of free barcode standards that can encode information in the code itself. There have been numerous attempts to monetise 2D barcodes and this is yet another. QR codes are free and can hold up to 4K of info with no need for a monetised database or online access. This will be dead within a few years.",2024-09-19 13:31:38
NaviLens,the camera only sometimes turns on after restarting the app,2024-08-28 02:11:49
NaviLens,This app seems really cool. I just wish that I could get the labels printed out on stickers so I would not need to have a sighted person cut the labels out for me. I would probably give all 5 stars if more companies would use this on their packaging.,2024-08-24 12:39:31
NaviLens,"It works really well, the detection speed is very fast and detection range is moderate. I'd like to have a setting to change the language of the speech instead of using the system language.",2024-06-05 04:27:33
NaviLens,It is very nice App and it helps bilnd to find,2024-05-29 04:23:55
NaviLens,"I don't have a visual impairment but was curious about what the colourful QR code on a box of cereal was so I googled it, read about NaviLens and then spent several minutes testing it out. I can imagine this is a game changer for visually impaired shoppers, so well done the NaviLens developers, and well done to the brands getting on board.",2024-05-06 02:16:44
NaviLens,What is the point of this app?,2024-04-22 23:59:40
NaviLens,Literally eye opening for sighted and blind.,2024-04-06 08:04:49
NaviLens,"It's great. Tells you what's in your eats! Can't always read the packages, anymore!",2023-10-28 06:43:17
NaviLens,When the talkback is on in my phone the application's voice is turned off. Talkback doesn't even tell what information is in the code. Even the haptic feedback of the phone is turned off. The application works normally after I turn off talkback. I am using this application from last 2 days. I am facing a lot of difficulties in scanning the codes. I request the development team to please improve the app as soon as possible. Mobile phone: Motorola Moto g82 5G Android version: 12,2023-08-05 09:07:41
NaviLens,Wow it is good to use.,2023-07-25 04:15:20
NaviLens,Might be a good app if it worked. Uninstalled as worthless. Stick to cereal.,2023-04-01 10:09:59

NaviLens,"Neosistec, in a review on here you replied to user Philip Pearn saying ""NaviLens is for blind users"". This contradicts the NaviLens About page which states ""This makes them useful for *blind ""and"" low vision people*. All you need to do is to point the camera of the device to a tag in order to quickly read its contents. So who is wrong? you or the information on the app About page?",2022-10-02 05:15:42
NaviLens,"Very very clever app, I hope it catches on",2022-07-11 00:26:10
NaviLens,"Amazing! Saw the tag on a packet of Kellogs and was intrigued. This app scans around for these tags and will point you in the direction of what you're looking for, read the information off of what has been entered. Life changing for visually impaired.",2022-05-25 01:11:26
NaviLens,Scanning is very accur as te and quick! Very interesting. Needs internet connection to read the data.,2022-05-24 00:37:00
NaviLens,Not a good App,2022-05-10 23:57:46
NaviLens,Very cool for VI students,2022-04-05 05:56:17
NaviLens,New but willing to learn this app. I like the colors and I really think hearing the directions will absolutely help myself when navigating through my areas.,2021-10-21 11:45:10
NaviLens,Not easy to use,2021-06-06 16:50:59

NaviLens,I enjoy this app. As a visually impaired person this helps me out a ton! I use this app at school and it is very useful in helping me get around.,2020-01-17 10:11:38
NaviLens,This app is stupid app I found,2020-01-17 10:10:36
OneStep Reader,"it's an absolute disgrace that they are asking over a €100 for an app like this. The only reason they can ask this amount is because in some European countries the government might give financial support to people with a visual disability. For the unlucky people who don't get this financial support, spending €100 on an app like this is basically unjustifiable and why would you, if you can't even get a trail to see if it actually works, supports your language and fulfills your expectations...",2025-03-26 06:32:29

OneStep Reader,"I couldn't figure out how to use it at all. I couldn't open the manual, no buttons responded so I have no idea how it's meant to work since you can't access instructions. I'm certainly not going to pay $150 for something I can't even try.",2024-03-12 01:13:19
OneStep Reader,It doesn't seem to work unless you pay $100! I'm severely visually impaired and the app doesn't seem to work and if so it's so confusing I can't seem to get it to work. Nor do I have $100 to put towards an app. Definitely uninstalling.,2023-08-04 11:36:15
OneStep Reader,I didn't read the reviews warning this is a scam but it is. If your product was good you wouldn't hide behind a paywall every single feature. That's not just shady but it's dumb. Not shockingly this app shared results in my googling with the also terrible Speechify,2023-04-08 10:32:16
OneStep Reader,"99 quid before you try it, no thanks.",2023-02-18 10:46:56
OneStep Reader,Costs £100 but won't let me try it first. No thanks.,2022-12-29 08:28:11
OneStep Reader,"My experience is it's highly expensive, otherwise the past couple times that I have tried to use it, it has been okay. It recognized text. Although it's very finicky with distance between the phone camera and the text on the paper. I can get the same functionality out of competitor apps for either a cheaper price, or for free.",2022-08-11 17:08:04
OneStep Reader,You cannot even try it before it asks for money.,2022-07-24 04:31:10
OneStep Reader,One of the worst app. Playstore should be checking apps before placing on site. I just wasted a lot of data for nothing. I can't even access the app before asking for payment of a huge some of money. That's nonsense,2022-06-18 02:05:32
OneStep Reader,"I've never used this app. The reason why will be obvious in a second. I find it hilarious how they said you'd never have to worry about getting overcharged, because it reads receipts. Then they turn around and charge you $100 to use the frickin thing. It may very well be a great app, I don't happen to have the $100 to find out.",2022-05-25 19:45:53
OneStep Reader,Interested about this app. It crashed as soon is I opened it. Uninstalled.,2022-04-07 09:49:05
OneStep Reader,Frustrating! The app can't read imported files. It crushes any time I try.,2022-04-02 09:18:28
OneStep Reader,Pay wall as soon as you go to try it. Absolutely trash.,2022-03-29 08:06:26
OneStep Reader,No use downloading it. It demands purchasing for $100 to operate.,2022-03-09 12:41:24
OneStep Reader,I absolutely agree with everyone else why should we pay a £999 plus something that we don't even know if it were Cs you should keep off a trial before by,2022-03-04 20:55:08
OneStep Reader,I'm frustrated as I would like to try this before I spend $100 and I can't get it to do anything without putting my credit card information in and I'm not offered any sort of free trial That seems crazy.,2022-03-04 11:06:27
OneStep Reader,"If the app is determined not to offer a free version then it should be labelled with its price tag, at the place of install button. Completely waste of time, and data. This should be flag as inappropriate due to the lack of information. There is no option to give 0 stars, otherwise I would have done it",2022-03-01 11:41:34
OneStep Reader,Since the name changed to OneStep Reader this app Is regularly changing my settings and overriding my choices of recognition language. On three occasions I have unselected all languages except English and told it which variant of English I wanted to use. On restarting the app and telling it the recognition language is English the app either selects and recognizes the English document as a non-English language or a variant of English other than the one I selected. Settings are changed.,2022-02-23 14:02:54
OneStep Reader,"The Android reader failed ""right out of the box"". I have tried for over a month to contact their support group, by phone and by their website support ""contact us"" email. No response. This feels like they have taken my money and run. After 6 weeks, with pressure from BBB and Google Play support, knfb notified me of an updated version, which I tried. The app does not crash now but it doesn't read bound books. DO NOT BUY THIS APP 😒😒",2022-02-17 06:09:03
OneStep Reader,Horrible horrific I can't even trial it. Don't waste your time,2022-02-16 19:00:41
OneStep Reader,"I am NOT paying £99 without seeing if it works first. Installing the app just gives you the interface. No trial run, no ""We will give you the first 10 words"", nothing. With Google Play not having a particularly helpful refund policy, its not worth the risk.",2022-01-14 00:23:07
OneStep Reader,I am not willing to pay $99 for an app I can't even test before buying. I was hoping to see if this was a good app to recommend the parents I work with. Guess I won't be recommending it since I can't even see how well it works.,2022-01-12 12:47:54
OneStep Reader,Horrible,2022-01-03 14:14:40
OneStep Reader,"This app used to be pretty good. I don't know what happened but sometimes when I use it, it doesn't do what it's supposed to. You know for what you pay for this thing you'd think it would be mostly decent. I mean there are apps that have like a fraction of the cost but they work way better! I think at one time or a number of times several years ago this app would be on sale for like $20. I think by now they should not sell this app for $100. It's not worth it. I mean I'm glad it's there for",2022-01-01 17:45:44

OneStep Reader,It appears to be working correctly again!,2021-09-20 12:45:26
OneStep Reader,Trial version doesn't do anything on my Samsung Note 10+ but the full version is expensive. I wouldn't spend £99.99 on any app without being sure it works and I find it useful.,2021-09-18 03:23:37
OneStep Reader,"It's free on playstore. But as soon as you open it, buy premium worth inr 7999 or u can't use a single feature. Waste of time",2021-09-11 22:05:36

OneStep Reader,99 bucks just before we can try it out is rediculous.,2021-07-20 15:45:19
OneStep Reader,You need to provide a at least a free might be limited time option to at least test the product. I don't mind investing in an app but I need to see first if it's what I need. I tried taking a photo on the app but I'm getting grayed out icons that I can't seem to take a snap or. do anything.,2021-07-15 15:53:36
OneStep Reader,Absolutely terrible. All features are locked and you need to pay $99 to use. Total trash.,2021-07-15 10:37:10
OneStep Reader,"Not a real app. It immediately prompts you to ""unlock full version for $99."" Everything else is grayed out and literally the only interactive option is to make a purchase. Don't list your app as ""free (with in-app purchases)"" if there are no free features and it can't be used unless you pay a hundred dollars.

I tryed it and is not good to live this 1 star review! You must try it and then you must live a review! I was so scared to buy it because of your reviews, but for me a future lawyer I am very glad to scan and read the Romanian law without a pc. If you are not satisfied whith the price just imagine how it costs to see! Do not misunderstand me! Is not cheep because romanian money are cheep so 1 usd is like 4.5 usd but my vision is more expensive then that! I am so glad that I can read !!! The reading devices are too expensive like the orcam my eye is 4 000 usd ! This is expensive not this app. Keep up the good work developers! Do not get descureged do this work for us for the people who need to read and who was borned whithout the capacity to read. Thenks a lot!

OneStep Reader,"An app that started off promising, has become an utter disaster! Though it provided lots of features and good OCR quality that could have made life more accessible in general, the current state of the app has just become absolutely pathetic. Though it is a rather expensive app on Google Play, there seem to be no functional support team. Each time there is an Android update, the app becomes disfunctional. and though Android 10 has been around for a while, the KNFB Reader hasn't got around to making itself functional. the app doesn't even start on my Nokia 6.1 running latest Android. Even when it used to run, it was nolonger able to recognize shared images from WhatsApp or other apps. A seriously regrettable purchase I must say, an absolute waste!",2020-03-02 14:00:37

OneStep Reader,Was working fine but keeps crashing will not even start.,2020-01-11 06:32:10
OneStep Reader,"No free trial, does not work just asks you to pay £99.99!!!!!",2020-01-10 13:20:57
OneStep Reader,100 without trying nope not happening,2020-01-09 22:18:14
OneStep Reader,No Android 10 support means this app is an expensive waste of space for me at present.,2020-01-06 02:45:51
OneStep Reader,When I update to 1 UI 2.0 Android 10 it no longer works on my Note 10+ or S10+ and still no reply from the programme's to update the app to work with Android 10.,2020-01-03 14:31:42
OneStep Reader,This is not free........ 😡,2019-12-25 12:41:32
OneStep Reader,"Attention! android users! Don't, again don't lose time nor money on this worthless app. It was good back nokia days, not anymore, they still use more than 10 years outdated back software practices",2019-12-21 22:37:18
OneStep Reader,Why would u make us install it and then u wont let us do anything,2019-12-18 08:21:46
OneStep Reader,"""KNFB reader keeps stopping"" is the only thing I see. Installed on a brand new Pixel 4.",2019-12-07 10:01:54
OneStep Reader,Sir please add Bangla language to this app so that we Bangladeshi blind people can read books in their own language please please,2019-11-18 01:52:46
OneStep Reader,Used to be my go-to app But now does not even open on Android 10.,2019-11-14 08:16:35
OneStep Reader,Great app but this app is broken. I can't open it from my Android phone. I've been waiting for the developers to fix this issue for months but no one is concerned about Android compatibility.,2019-10-31 09:52:13
OneStep Reader,no update for android 10. please update the app.,2019-10-28 23:39:33
OneStep Reader,"A stack trace shows the Java DRM library breaks the app everytime there is an OS update. Why on earth is it OS version dependent at all? Can't you verify my purchase of the app some other way? Maybe find a way that doesn't break every few months? It's always sad to see good software broken by bad DRM. You can do better! Sincerely, a paying customer.",2019-10-18 18:17:20
OneStep Reader,This app is not being updated and is no longer usable. The app can't even open on my phone. Very sad and a waste of money,2019-10-07 11:46:01
OneStep Reader,"Like others say, it's a waste of time. The creators of the app should allow people to rent monthly or give 1-2 free scans before prompting us to purchase. Who the hell is paying 100 for this without being able to test if it works?!?!?! BYE. Really bad business!! Can't actually say if it works or not but that's irrelevant because unless it can read my thoughts too, it's not worth 100.",2019-10-06 16:18:37
OneStep Reader,Won't work unless you pay 100 dollars to unlock. Wanted to see if it would be useful for auntie. Guess I will never know. Unsurprising it gets such bad reviews.,2019-09-23 03:52:24
OneStep Reader,"Couldn't even try it once to check if it worked. Screen text stated I'd used it up before I started, and it didn't even read that to me.",2019-09-17 08:44:15
OneStep Reader,Wouldn't even let me test the app once.. immediately wanted $139.00...are you seriously expecting payment without testing the potential of this app?,2019-08-27 08:28:54
OneStep Reader,"As others have said, you can't even try the app. When you start it, it says you have 0 recognitions left. I have emailed the creators of this app and if I don't get a reply, I'm going to consider this app to be a scam.",2019-08-27 04:39:54
OneStep Reader,Started the app for the first time and it said I had zero recognitions left. Can't even test it and no obvious instructions available. Price is over 100 dollars which is probably reasonable but I can't test it.,2019-08-24 11:52:36
OneStep Reader,doesn't even let me try the application.,2019-08-01 15:55:54
OneStep Reader,"The app wouldn't let me test it. I wished to try it out for my child, however it told me I would need to pay 100$ to even try it. I don't even know if this product works, I feel like I have been scammed. It is hard finding things for sight disabled that works well, so this really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I guess it's back to Google translate, and having the home language side read out loud.",2019-07-30 11:44:08
OneStep Reader,"Installed trial version for the first time. It immediately prompted me to pay $99 for the full version, saying there were no conversions left. Deleted it.",2019-07-27 13:40:46
OneStep Reader,A very good app for the visually impired . best ocr .,2019-07-22 22:07:54
OneStep Reader,why is it silent when i press play? more ui voice feedbadk needed. eg does it need network or it thinks i have free vers for example,2019-07-14 00:58:00
OneStep Reader,unusable trial version. will make you pay for the full version. this sucks.,2019-07-13 15:47:40
OneStep Reader,it is very costly and bogus app I don't want to recommend anyone,2019-06-11 05:19:25
OneStep Reader,"Way to take advantage of the disabled, you cant try it without paying 140.",2019-05-30 22:12:24
OneStep Reader,horrible app... went to try and use it my VERY first time... and it kepy telling that I had no more texts recognitions available and to get the full version for $99.99. so it's just a scheme to get you to download the app and then try to get you to download the full version or pay for the full version immediately it's stupid,2019-05-27 02:38:52
OneStep Reader,"installed on Android in order to evaulate it to recommend to a blind person, didnt get any free evaluation scans. i support disabled people in university and would like access so i can recommend it to them",2019-05-24 02:18:44
OneStep Reader,the app says zero documents left when you first in install it....i can't evaluate it and won't spend $100 before i know it works or not. looking for an app for my blind dad,2019-05-17 11:25:30
OneStep Reader,Cannot evaluate. It says zero recognitions left without allowing a single test!,2019-05-13 06:05:51
OneStep Reader,Waste. Complete waste of time and data.,2019-05-03 03:23:19
OneStep Reader,Don't download no instructions!!! nothing works .they just want $$$$!,2019-05-01 06:37:19
OneStep Reader,Not happy with its limits when competes with free apps that work better,2019-04-30 12:55:00
OneStep Reader,Everything is great but it will be awsome if you can add hindi,2019-03-26 07:45:47
OneStep Reader,Hi the app is amazing but it keeps saying I have 43 recognition left even though I've already paid for the app. please advise what to do,2019-03-13 14:03:54
OneStep Reader,Please add more languages such as Portuguese I am from Brazil and I know that about a people would benefit from this app,2019-03-09 13:26:24
OneStep Reader,This app sucks,2019-03-04 15:41:51
OneStep Reader,"You know there's problems with the app when you install the evaluation copy and you can't even give it an evaluation. Says 0 evaluations left when I first opened the app... immediate uninstall. Was gonna recommend to a friend, not gonna happen. $160? Pfft...",2019-02-27 23:39:26
OneStep Reader,It doesnt work at all and ask you to rate them!!!!,2019-02-23 13:41:52
OneStep Reader,Totally time- vaste apps no need to purchase it use other ocr recognition Not working on stock Android recognition quality was very bad totally waste of my money,2018-12-21 18:40:15
OneStep Reader,friends dont use this its not working.useless app,2018-12-17 22:09:18
OneStep Reader,"Please add Hindi OCR also, please please",2018-12-15 09:22:51
OneStep Reader,"I got an update recently, but after updating, it is bugging me to buy this again. I mailed my problem, but no response so far. Using nokia6.1 Android pi. I tried by reinstalling and even by clearing the data and cash, no use still. . ?",2018-12-14 18:24:37
OneStep Reader,EDIT:  Updated review rating as App now works on Android 9.,2018-12-14 12:38:55

OneStep Reader,Doesn't open on my pixel 3. Just crashes.,2018-11-26 20:42:30
OneStep Reader,WARNING! Don't purchase this app. The developers are not updating anymore. Does not work on Android 9 and I have not had any response to my emails.,2018-10-26 02:41:32

OneStep Reader,This is very helpful.,2018-09-30 00:31:16
OneStep Reader,"This is very good application, but it is very costly.",2018-09-03 18:19:02
OneStep Reader,"I really loved this app in the trial version, but then I realized that it cost $100 to unlock the rest of the app. It's a really great tool, but definitely not worth that much. They should at least have discounts for students or people with disabilities or something",2018-08-29 09:48:41
OneStep Reader,"I have taken my laziness to the next level thanks to this app. Instead of 
reading a school book i can take photos and just have it read to me while i 
drive or play on my phone. Probably not the way it was meant to be used, 
but this app is awesome and saves me a bunch of time because i am so easily 
distracted",2018-08-20 23:01:50
OneStep Reader,"This app no longer works since the upgrade to Android 9.0. Using it on my 
Google Pixel and it crashes each time it starts. Will be grateful if this 
could be fixed as soon as possible. Other than that a fantastic app 
providing accessibility to visually impaired people. Thanks",2018-08-18 12:47:28
OneStep Reader,"This app used to be great. Now it crashes at launch. Maybe it doesn't 
support Andrew pie.",2018-08-18 12:21:10
OneStep Reader,"I am using the trial version right now but it seems to work well. I am told 
that the iPhone version is better than the Android version. I am legally 
blind so any app that can read this well is a great advantage. I have 
waited all of my life for this kind of aid. I have used the Kurzweil 3000 
in the past but being able to hold any document in my hand has been a 
blessing.",2018-07-31 03:26:27
OneStep Reader,"Worst app ever. I needed it to read out of a textbook for me because I'm 
dyslexic and it will only read entire pages to you so the little bit of 
text I need isn't covered.",2018-07-28 13:02:59
OneStep Reader,It did not work at all,2018-07-13 10:22:26
OneStep Reader,It got like 90% of the words wrong and wasn't helpful at all,2018-07-08 21:31:23
OneStep Reader,It is too expensive for blind people to buy the app!!,2018-07-02 17:35:48
OneStep Reader,"I am sighted, and was testing this app for recommendation to my 
non-technical blind friend for daily use. Books and newspapers can be 
accessed and read online these days, and she's looking for a tool to help 
with daily tasks such as counting calories, reading signs, and reading 
product instructions and recipe cards. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend 
this app. I tested it on nutrional facts, and they were spoken without any 
pauses at all, making a list of useful data into a confusing stream of 
alternating numbers and words - it skipped one chart almost entirely! I'm 
not sure if the app even read the calorie information, come to think of it. 
I also tested it using a clear picture of the flat back of a cleaning 
spray, and the cautions and instructions were unintelligible, with quite a 
few strings of rarely-used characters such as carets and mathematical 
symbols inserted into the text. I compared the same image of the back of 
the chemical spray using Google translate OCR, and it handled adequately, 
conveying the meaning of the instructions clearly enough to be useful - so 
the legibility of the recognized text is definitely not due to the quality 
of the image. I suspect aerosols would fare more poorly! I do like the 
option to tell you the orientation of the page, but even that could be 
improved by perhaps using a series of bells (low for counterclockwise, high 
for clockwise, and tinkling when centered, for instance) to direct 
orientation instead of relying on a guess-and-check system.",2018-06-20 07:55:27
OneStep Reader,When it scans its like it never scaned what I was reading!!!! This app was so usless...,2018-04-10 17:46:38
OneStep Reader,I love the voice of robot woman that reads the rules of application.,2018-03-12 12:55:42
OneStep Reader,"Waste of money. Audio screeches and is maddening. For $100, the device should perform satisfactorily.",2018-03-01 08:47:46
OneStep Reader,Confusing uninstalled immediately,2018-02-12 14:51:04
OneStep Reader,This app is okay if you are using it to quickly read something a menu price tag a quick description of something but I attempted to use it to read a textbook and it does not help it doesn't have the right pauses doesn't recognize a grouping of a sentence it will stop mid-sentence or mid paragraph and then resume it also doesn't read things left to right such as a chart it reads it top to bottom so it's just not helpful in the manner that I expected to use it I definitely don't think it's worth the price,2018-02-01 11:24:20
OneStep Reader,Way better then google,2018-01-25 11:32:04
OneStep Reader,Good for work,2018-01-25 09:02:48
OneStep Reader,You have to pay £100 to use this I can't pay £100 I haven't got the money,2018-01-12 01:16:28

OneStep Reader,Only installed this recently and was still getting used to it and thought it had a lot of potential but now for some reason it has stopped working,2017-04-15 13:36:42
OneStep Reader,This app works excellently as intended. Note: place documents on a stand like the Fopydo or stand the document upright before scanning to get the best results. KNFB needs to mention this to users in the app description.,2017-02-28 18:41:29
OneStep Reader,"Great app, still indian languages should b included",2017-02-12 06:03:11
OneStep Reader,Every blind / vision impaired individual with a smartphone or tablet should own this app - it makes organizing paper documents easy by saving the captured text to your device it's an excellent way to go paperless. The only two minor issues that prevent a 5-star rating are 1. It's tricky to capture document field if you have no vision at all and 2. If you happen to own both Android / iOS devices there's no way to download a single app on both devices without purchasing twice...,2017-02-01 20:02:34
OneStep Reader,It is an amazing app for visually impaired/impaired,2017-02-01 08:43:33
OneStep Reader,This works so accurately - taking an immediate photo of a whole A4 printed sheet and reading it out immediately. Using a dark matt background behind the reading material and checking that the light is good helps accuracy.,2017-01-07 10:07:19
OneStep Reader,It's useful for me hotstar,2016-11-30 07:12:48

OneStep Reader,"Two main issues I had were the need to double tap while holding the device still resulted in blurry pictures. The bigger issue, though, was that while reading, the recognised text is displayed on the screen. TalkBack can see there is text on the screen, so TalkBack also starts reading the text out but slightly behind KNFB's voice.  You can't make out what either voice is reading to you as they both do it together.",2016-11-06 03:08:23
OneStep Reader,"If I backed it up for future installation,, it doesn't launch. it's terrific! all the other applications works like a charm! It is too costly.",2016-11-05 11:54:25

OneStep Reader,"But my anti virus scanner is reporting this app as malware.  The anti virus app is Clean master and it is rather disturbing.

Once the above issues are resolved I will revise my review but some ""how to do"" help would be nice.",2016-03-30 11:41:29

OneStep Reader,"Most useful app ,I like this useful app",2016-03-03 23:33:02
OneStep Reader,"Some folks may regard this app as being too expensive, but I think it's worth every cent. Other OCR apps compare very poorly to KNFB. I recommend using this app with the Standscan Pro, results are just so much better than taking free-hand shots. Great job, keep it up!",2016-02-29 05:53:36
OneStep Reader,I can't rightfully give this app less stars due to cost..its amazing! I'm Dyslexic and returning to school for my masters! I wish it were more cost effective for students but that does not take away from the use or the great help this app has already been on free trial..ALL Dyslexics should have this! I don't know if unlocking the full app will allow me to change the voice but I hope it can. If not please add feature for more ease of understanding and reading pleasure! Thank you for this app! Wow just WOW.,2016-02-16 18:58:10
OneStep Reader,Great for those times when I really need access to print. I'm especially impressed by its ability to read off of a laptop screen when the screen reader has crashed.,2016-02-09 08:47:16
OneStep Reader,Only 25 transcriptions before we have to shell out money. Just another reason why I believe we should be subject to eugenics.,2016-01-20 12:24:25
OneStep Reader,"Very good app, with the potential to be very useful for people with poor sight.  As other reviewers have noted, an earlier version of the app required an internet/wifi connection to function. However, I spoke to the app developers about this, and they have removed this restriction in a recent release, and I was very impressed that they responded to user feedback in this way.  The interface isn't perfect though -- I think there are some improvements that could be made to make it easier to use for people with poor sight.",2015-12-31 09:37:28
OneStep Reader,I have installed the app in my Motoxplay mobile. it reads almost 99% accurately. It is a good companion to visually impaired people.,2015-12-21 08:17:28

I've had this on my other phone since it's release I believe, and this is to my knowledge the *only* app with a light detector in it. Great when you're in an unfamiliar place overnight, such as a hotel for a gig and want to make sure your room is as dark as you expect it to be... I find the short-text feature very satisfactory as well, just as much as it is elsewhere.",2023-12-04 10:17:31

TapTapSee,Honestly it's not that accurate. I tried to put crayons in front of it so I could tell me. It wouldn't. It's not that accurate and then you could only use the back camera. And it just doesn't really pick up on stuff. Maybe if it was developed more than maybe I would try it again but this is not that accurate. Honestly I wouldn't really recommend it. I love where it's headed though. I really do. But I just think that it should be developed more maybe add some more features also for the video fun,2023-12-27 23:21:19

Out of hundreds of pictures taken--everything from the sky, to a ceiling light, to a road, to a vacuum, to a car in motion, to a parked car, to a chair, to a crock pot--there was only one time it was tripped up, and that was forgivable; it mistook a white bathmat hanging on a towel rack for a white bath towel.

Seeing AI,"Overall this is the most useful app on my phone. However, I'm getting sick of the occasional reset of settings between launches. EG. I'll have my channels ordered and everything set the way I want and scan some mail, money etc.
A few days later I need to scan one simple thing and I'm forced to bypass/skip the little introduction to Seeing AI thing. When i'm in a hurry and having to faff about with things I already did, I consider uninstalling this app and just looking elsewhere. I understand this is free, and how we should all be grateful. But this is a longstanding issue and I'm tired of the reset btn being pressed in Seeing AI configuration so I have to set everything up again. Oh, and that includes the annoying tutorial popups for each mode. As if I haven't used this app for 7 years regularly now. Please please address this and soon. There's probably more people out there experiencing this random reset behavior and too nice to be critical of a free app.
Other than that, one of the best recognition apps and I've tried them all.",2025-04-12 05:45:00

Seeing AI,"This app was great until recently. I used this app to scan money, scan products, and read text, but the recent updates have made it very terrible for me. You can no longer do money scanning on the app, and they took away the really short text feature, so now you have to take a picture of the document which is not easy for some people, even with the camera help.

Hopefully they can fix the reading problem in the future.",2025-02-22 06:01:31

Seeing AI,"the updates keep getting better, from the jumping text, they fixed it, to the document channel being sluggish and now that's fixed. microsoft is doing an excellent job and no account needed and this all free. love it. my one thing is I would love the seen preview and where you share photos from the share sheet to have a way to interact with the AI like you can now in the document channel. these guys brought much more rich descriptions to the seen and share sheets, but theres no interactions with it, if you could ask it followup you would have a 5 star app I think. edit, you can now ask seeingAI questions about your photo, this is fantastic.   I have no problem recommending this app and the other thing i'll say is working with microsoft's seeingAI staff via email you get quick responces. I do not work with them but what I mean is like emailing them, their turnaround time has ben rather snappy I feel. they seem to really get blind people with their seeingAI here and its just getting better.edit, as of Version 5.5, the interface is much more streamlined, I didn't think it possible to make it any easier but they did, and they blended a few channels into one, like the read tab is short text and document all in one and you also have the option to toggle with a button with document alignment and you can even take a photo in that tab. theres so much more they did and its just excellent and we still get access to the older stuff. I love the describe tab updates, now you get a rich description right out of the gate when you snap a photo or load one. its excellent thank you so much Microsoft and team over at seeing AI.",2025-02-08 08:05:59
Seeing AI,"I just downloaded this app, and so far, I’m really impressed with its functionality. Please keep it going! I’m not blind, nor is my dad, who I actually downloaded it for. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, which causes hallucinations, making it difficult for him to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. He once mentioned that he wished he could point his phone at something and have it tell him whether it was real. That led me to search for apps, and I came across this one.

We plan to use it during his episodes—either he can use his phone himself, or we, as caregivers, can assist him—so he can have confirmation of reality. I’m especially impressed with the describe feature and how detailed it is in explaining what’s being seen. So far, I’m really happy with it. Keep up the great work!",2025-02-05 12:00:30

One example is it recognized a Ferris wheel it’s said wheel, Ferris wheel, tourist attraction. It also said people waiting for the bus at night.

I’m updating my update tonight. I discovered that this app can describe videos. But the video has to be two minutes or less. The five minute mark is too large for the video. And it can only give you 10 videos per day. But if you delete the app and start over, you can do as many videos as you want. can you please fix that so the videos can be more than five minutes? thank you.",2024-11-01 18:22:46

Seeing AI,"Overall, I have found this app very useful and accomplishing day-to-day tasks such as identifying canned goods or sorting the mail. However, it is very inconsistent ( and unacceptably so) in its ability to read the output of digital displays. FYI, I am speaking throughout this review of the short text channel. I use this app every day to read my kitchen scale for making coffee and for other reasons. At times, it reads the output quickly and accurately. At other times, it takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to read the display. Words are inadequate to describe the frustration I feel when a 30-second task turns into a 10-minute one, draining my phone battery all the while. If a pair of human eyeballs can read the display, then there should be no reason why Seeing AI cannot also read it. This problem seems particularly exacerbated by readings that end in either 1 or 7 (such as 21 G). The app has no problem reading the labels of the buttons on the scale, but it all too often fails to read literally the only thing on the display I want to hear. Perhaps a new channel could be created in the app that is optimized specifically for the reading of displays. Please work on this! In a world in which many home appliances are still inaccessible, it is more important than ever that blind people have access to an app like Seeing AI that is capable of reading a display. My rating reflects the frustration caused by the app's seeming inability to accomplish one of its core functions in situations that I need it most. I commit to updating my rating when this issue is addressed.",2024-04-26 11:08:32

It’s be great if that issue is looked into. Great app!",2024-04-10 13:52:48
Seeing AI,I am a completely blind user of this app. I love the app 😊 I use it with voice over the screen mirror on Apple products with my iPhone. The only problem that I am seeing is it does not do a good job when you try to use it with those 2 L bottles of pop that people get Voice is not reading me any of the information the camera isn’t working and whether I use the short text or document mode it doesn’t work and doesn’t help and also voiceover is having trouble. It doesn’t say hold steady every time to know the cameras in the right place and lined up it’s not telling me every single time I think it’s a bug please fix all this if you can and add another mood for reading labels on 2 L bottles of pop. Thank you.,2024-01-31 04:35:43

My only complaint is that we can’t wear a camera or and it is in progress to use the world setting for indoor use only at the moment it would make sense to me that person could make maybe glasses that you could wear with the success of the Seeing AI app in them or you could hold your phone up and it could describe the world around you, and if it could get good enough at this, you could walk around and be told some of how to get around you were still use your cane with the other hand, it also might be good if you had a FaceTime option and you had a live person that could come through and see what you’re looking at on the phone when your loan so they can describe things for you should be another good option for them to add and how come, they’re not helping the blind get those cars that I should do drive we’re supposed to be helping the disabled I approve of the Seeing AI app if you could get the cameras in glasses and have that app and maybe a FaceTime person person with ice blind could possibly navigate streets they would still want to pay attention with their cane",2023-12-29 18:32:00
Seeing AI,"Before now, all problems that I had run into seemed to be fixed, but now, I ran into an issue with a wrong product. I was looking for my members Mark onion powder, and instead of telling me that it was onion powder, it told me that it was GV thin spaghetti. I obviously knew that was not thin spaghetti, and decided to start opening packages to see what they were so that I could find the right thing. It turned out that what it told me was spaghetti, was the onion powder that I was looking for. it's fortunate for everybody in my household that I'm not the one with the cold that I was making soup for, or we could've ended up with something really off the wall in the soup because I wouldn't have been able to smell it. The problem is, when we run into a problem like this, there's no button to report a problem, so it's going to start telling everybody that members mark onion powder is great value thin spaghetti, which if you shake it, it's obviously not, and it's not even in a container that thin spaghetti would be in, but for somebody who has never cooked, or is just learning, they won't know that it's the wrong kind of package. Spaghetti is typically in cellophane or cardboard, and this giant thing of onion powder is a plastic container. This is something that we need. We need to be able to report a wrong product if it's telling us that it's one thing, when it isn't. I have known older people who store everything in the same place, whether it's edible or not, if it's kitchen related, it goes in the cupboard, regardless. I have known people who have stored rat poison in the same cupboard as spices because it's too high for kids to get into, and I would really hate for somebody to put rat poison in their food by accident because this app told them that it was something edible. I'm not one of these people, and don't even keep rat poison in my house, but unfortunately, I know people who do. I could see this being a deadly mistake if we don't have a place to report wrong product uPC's. also, in one developer response to somebody, it says go to seeingai.com to see improvements in the app, but that just takes us right back here to the App Store.",2023-09-30 16:40:52

Seeing AI,Love this app. I lost my vision three years ago and was told that this app is very useful. I use it almost daily on the go in at home. Everything works pretty seamless except for the color reader which can be kind of an accurate at times. It would be amazing if you guys can add some thing that would be able to read digital clocks. Unfortunately a lot of my devices in my home have digital clocks like my stove my washing machine my thermostat etc. I do use a lot of smart devices in my home but some of them are not able to be hooked up to my smart devices. So it would be pretty cool if I could hold the phone in front of the stove to see what temperature the oven is on or how much time is left on the washing machine etc. Overall absolutely love this application. Keep up the good work,2021-10-25 06:03:01
Seeing AI,I can’t recommend it highly enough. Does exactly as advertised. Can’t beat the price either,2021-10-15 13:31:45
Seeing AI,"This app makes my life much easier. While not being totally blind but with about 5% vision I can still see the little icons in the bottom. Haven’t used everything yet but the short text, document reader, currency, and color has come in very handy. You know you don’t want to look silly and where mismatch clothes lol.

So I just use the product tab and figured out there was another icon that it would read me more information. The short text doesn’t always read the instructions well for heating but the extra product info gave me all the information I needed. This app matched with my Alexa microwave/oven/air fryer is going to be absolutely marvelous together. Thank you for this app and thank you for continuing to update it.",2021-10-14 06:28:22

Seeing AI,I'm visually impaired and I always had to ask people to read things to me or discribe things for me. That wasn't always easy because there wasn't always people around me. But when I found this app I was like yay this will help me a lot! And it is helping me so much! Now when I want something discribed for me all I have to do is go to Seeing AI. Thank you so much for making this app!,2021-09-26 11:05:22

1 out 5 items scanned found

Seeing AI,I recently became blind. Your application has allowed me to be able to read my mail and read products that I have at home on my shelves and  allowed me to pay the taxi driver using your money identifier without fear of being ripped off. I would like to see the barcode scanner improved with more product availability. A lot of times it just says no description available. I would love to see this app available on the Mac so that I can scan my mail using my scanner. Just a thought :-),2021-06-24 05:59:20
Seeing AI,Absolutely love this app I use it all the time because whenever I buy groceries sometimes I may forget what I bot I need to figure out where to put it but sometimes it is hard for me to read the letters on boxes and things either because the letters are too small or the letters are too different from just normal print text seriously love this app. Thankyou! The only thing that I would say I would like to have if it’s even possible is I have a very hard time with expiration dates I always have to have someone come down and read it for me and I have not found a single app that has been able to find and read expiration dates don’t know if that’s possible if not that’s fine it would just be nice thing to have I’m even very skeptical about eating things in my fridge and pantry just because I don’t know if it’s any good or not and I don’t wanna have to call someone to say hey can you come tell if this is good or not so it definitely is a real problem for me don’t really know what else to do so if that is a feature that is possible to be added it would be great but again I very much love this app it has made my life so much easier thank you again,2021-04-24 17:33:43

Seeing AI,"Pro’s -
• Does what it says, how it says without glitches or ads.
• Doesn’t try to profit off the disability of others, giving us what comes free to others.
Con’s -
• People Recognition has to be done by taking their picture & many refuse to allow that. It would be easier if it can be done by a previously taken photo. This way permission isn’t needed to know who is around you!
• Vague description on objects & animals. Would love to know if it’s my dachshund or Chihuahua eating or just came in, I already know both are dogs!
Tips -
• To be a navigational assistance as well can erase the need of multiple apps & can be the one stop shop for the blind!
• Adding the option to use previous taken photos to recognize those around us.

And when I hold my phone in front of text for short text it’s just reads about a quarter of the text and it makes no sense because it puts it in different orders and it makes no sense to me

And for my book reader when I hold it in front of the barcode it starts making big score faster and faster and then but it never takes the picture of the beeps just freeze and the app crash crashes

We have tried and use many apps and other technologies to help him access the world of print. Despite his struggles, he is a voracious consumer of audiobooks and this app allows him to access print around the environment with so much less effort than other apps.

I am so very sorry if you don’t understand my review.
Let me get to the point it helps me, and it makes me laugh. I recommended for blind and visually impaired people and kids all alike. I can describe things and color scenery people money parentheses same thing this morning you can also described like you can read a book to you or document can you print read your homework if it’s not in braille 17! Anyway I’m only 10 years old i’m only 10 to 10 years old what do you expect for me like I’m just a kid what do you expect. I don’t do much when is my nap and I have fun and I love you and I love math that’s all that matters family and friends that’s why my daddy got me this app it’s quite amazing I enjoy it it’s wonderful I would recommend it for every single person in animal there is out there yeah animal just look at my rating of five stars I’m not kidding sorry if this review is so long but it’s for your own goods

I love cats I know I’m going to scream and this will help me to my dinghy mean cancel my Books app and brow on Tigard there for a little kids come on who wants to re-find your own books one who wants read books for five-year-olds when they’re 10 seriously seriously are you kidding me hello keep reading?!!!!!!!!! 

I recommend

I recommend that you add more things to your out to me why so I can see how old you are you know who is or you can like be used outside I tried it outside once and you didn’t work can you fix that?!

This is a really long long movie for teen! I am just trying to tell everyone how good this happens I heard the review about the stupid Facebook mission thing to wrong like I mean it just makes me laugh when I guess the wrong name I am too but I guess I was like five or seven or three or four and want to even make me want to sound all that and that he enjoys your new mother and younger image means one to your family sure I want to have friends over but it’s a pretty good app 

I do a lot of stuff anyway enjoy some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it another time it’s not a made in pain I had to giggle about that want to do you guys any new you I do a lot of stuff anyway I’m enjoying some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it and another tell me tell me an opinion I had a giggle about that want to do you guys any new people that say that something you know is kind of weird because it’s not working you guys might be right but you guys are wrong as well and you shouldn’t know if it’s wrong it’s just it’s not
 

Anyway I don’t know much and what was I saying oh yeah so people can just have a laugh about it instead of complaining to you guys everyone should have a box of medication laughter is the best medicine just take some funny pictures and have a good life and you should be cured that is the best medicine laughter is the best medicine understand if you can’t figure out what the medicine is when I ask ask someone who can’t see I can’t see really good myself out of me to reach mom. But I can still use this app why I want to say when you say well for some envelopes and I found all the information from my school on my own without

Once I even use this app to read envelopes and I found all the envelopes from my school on my own except for the set this up was my only guide you must just keep flipping the box with the Haitian around and eventually you’ll find the right spot that’s what I do with the envelopes sure he takes a while but after a while it’s worth it I love school it’s the best thing everyone just needs to chill lax it’s not a big deal. Everyone just keeps saying all this that this that blah blah blah it’s annoying so I need you to do people is to download this app my review should and if you more things

So anyway the next thing is to blow my true name I know it’s is with me and I will have you go to Abby Cool whatever I want I want to talk I think I don’t know I’m using voice so I don’t know why it’s wrong here is my true identity and the next thing he wake ups

Seeing AI,"I installed this app the day I first heard of it, while listening to the ACB national convention nearly two years ago.  Even though I had had KNFB Reader for a number of years, I mainly added this one for comparison, but soon discovered that it compares favorably with the aforementioned app, as well as with other light-detecting, color-identifying and currency-reading apps I have used over the last five years. I soon realized that I needed to get a newer iPhone in order to use the Products feature—which I did.  I use the app just about every day, for everything from reading mail to reading books, some magazines, and cooking instructions on that packaged dinner I just pulled out of the freezer, and even making sure that coupon I plan to use at a local business hasn’t expired.  The Short Text works especially well, for those times you don’t wish to scan an entire document.  For most things, the Document channel works well, and I like it that the focusing is done automatically.  However, there are occasions when I get the “No text recognized” alert; so then, I revert to KNFB Reader, and sometimes it does a better job reading that document.  I am totally blind from birth; so I am assuming that the documents for which I get that alert are those printed in multiple colors, and with numerous graphics that land smack in the middle of the written text.  I can’t vouch for the color identifier channel—as I have never been able to see color; but, knowing that lighting can affect the way color is perceived—even by a good set of eyes—my take is that any attempt at a color identifier is better than none at all.  The currency reader has improved markedly since the app first came out.  I have been able to read a number of handwritten greeting cards—and other items as well—with the Handwriting channel.  The light detector has saved me any amount of grief, since I have a number of light switches (for overhead lights, of course), which are push-buttons rather than up-and-down toggles; and, we all know people who can’t remember to turn the lights off when they leave.  I’ve had considerable fun with the Scene channel, which is often quite accurate.  I have occasionally had a bit of difficulty getting the bar-code reader (Product channel) to work; but then, bar codes aren’t always in the same location on a box or container.  Just today, I had to search diligently for the bar code on a frozen meal, in order to then read the cooking instructions.  By the time I found and read that information, my battery status had dropped precipitously, from 85 to 60 percent!  If one is using the app for any length of time at a stretch, I suggest that they either have their phone plugged in, or have an external battery handy, as it is a major drain.  On the other hand, this afternoon I was able to read an online menu—which was otherwise totally inaccessible because it was an _image— from a local restaurant.  In this case, SeeingAI did a better job reading it than KNFB Reader!  Finally, to those who insist that there is no currency reader channel, could it be that they are still on an iPhone 5S or earlier?  And to those who insist that the app doesn’t work well with VoiceOver, perhaps they are just new to VoiceOver and need help with it?  This has really been a life-changing app!  I look forward to even more improvements and enhancements, and apologize for the length of this review.",2019-05-26 16:28:26

 I love several of the channels that this app provides. The product, document and short text are great. The document channel especially is great. I purchase another app a while back for $100 and this app works better. I love that I do not have to presss a button to take the picture. 
I found the person channel fun, but not very useful. I do not find the color channel accurate. I have better success with tap tap See for colors. I used the color channel on a white shirt and when it was on the sleeves it would say grey and on the front or back of the shirt it would say brown. 
The currency channel is just as good as the other apps  available It is very accurate.",2018-11-09 09:02:21
Seeing AI,"I truly love this iPhone application As someone who is completely blind. I have only one thing that could make this app better. Please add a PDF conversion channel. I cannot even say how many times I receive digital documents from professors and others in my college experience. This is just something that is essential for me personally, but if it was able to be added to the app that would be great.",2018-11-07 05:22:24
Seeing AI,"Dear seeing ai team.
.
Please add arabic language there are many blind people in saudi arabia that wants the arabic language in seeing ai so plz add it as fast as possible (;",2018-10-02 09:32:59
Seeing AI,It would be really cool if we could use facial recognition with Photos we already have. I don’t see my family a lot so they send me pictures and I have no way to put in facial recognition because they’re not here to take the picture themselves.,2018-09-14 08:45:56
Seeing AI,Thank you Microsoft for creating this app keep up the good work to make this app even better,2018-09-11 04:22:27
Seeing AI,Your recently update where you can load photos in and Id them dose not work. It dose not show picture and it dose not dispribe anything but it says YESTERDAY AT 1:pm,2018-07-22 05:08:34
Seeing AI,The short text reader is very quick and mostly accurate. Great for on the fly reading of bottles lotions and things like that. The document reader is very cool. You just hold it over the document and wait for it to take the picture as you were just. The other tabs did some work that’s why I only gave it a four star rating. It’s nice that when the document is processed it even keeps most of the formatting. KNFB reader does not do that. It just runs everything together. Very nice product. I wonder how long it will be free?,2018-07-20 08:26:12
Seeing AI,this is a great app! I have used it to identify products and read documents. Keep up the great work! I really appreciate any app that helps the blind. I have been mostly blind all of my life. So anything like this makes a huge difference. Thanks again.,2018-07-05 19:27:42
Seeing AI,How do you change the language to Spanish ?,2018-06-30 16:58:07
Seeing AI,"I love using the products mode for identifying not only food, but also cleaning products and also DVDs. I love how it will give you cooking directions or if you’re looking at a DVD it will tell you what the movie is about. I have not tried out the money Channel yet but from what I have seen in  videos it works well. I also love using the document channel for reading mail. The handwriting mode also works great. My husband and I tried it out and we both were amazed that it read his handwriting. It told me Exactly what he wrote without any mistakes. It is small things like being able to read a handwritten note from a friend or family member that really makes this app special. I would love to see medication be added to the bar code scanner. This app is great. Please keep updating it.",2018-06-27 15:59:29
Seeing AI,"I’m legally blind, and have been since birth. I can use the Facial recognition feature to help me see my niece and nephew. Plus, I can be more independent. Keep up the good work.",2018-06-14 17:40:51
Seeing AI,"The app is great except for the huge battery drain. I had 93 percent battery, scanned a barcode, and was down to 80. That's one hell of a drain  if you ask me.",2018-06-11 11:50:21
Seeing AI,I just found out that seeing a I can read the back of my inhaler there’s a little box that tells you how many you have left I always have to ask somebody and now ate seeing a I can do it for me I love this app,2018-06-11 10:04:11
Seeing AI,The only reason why I downloaded this was to see if it could register my penis sadly it did not must have been too small ☹️ but the other objects I pointed it at were really accurate also how will a blind person find the button to take the picture you should add the feature where you press the volume button to take the pic,2018-06-09 01:54:07
Seeing AI,Nice. I just wish it could identify more products.,2018-05-31 20:24:21
Seeing AI,I am a visually impaired individual and I always have trouble scanning barcodes when trying to label things. Create a better method of product identification that will be helpful to all.,2018-05-27 12:30:10
Seeing AI,Thanks Microsoft for making an app like that. I’ts very helpful. 😉,2018-05-24 05:03:24
Seeing AI,"Love this app so much. I like how it has so many different uses all in one app. I hate when I have to download a bunch of apps that I don't even know will work, but this one does work for sure. I still can't find my money reader, so I just use the currency preview mode. Thank you guys for thinking of us and our community!",2018-05-23 16:45:06
Seeing AI,I was so excited to find this app for my mother who is completely blind. She uses the voiceover for all functions on her phone. When she went to use the app the voiceover recognized the buttons at the bottom as one large button instead of individuals. This makes it impossible to switch from say short text to product scanner. It’s always stuck on the short text button. It would be an amazing app if this wasn’t an issue. Sadly we’ll have to look for something else until this is fixed.,2018-05-20 18:16:02
Seeing AI,Thank you so much for creating this. Best tool for us dyslexics and have troubles reading. 🙏🏽🖖🏽,2018-05-18 18:11:33
Seeing AI,"When you open the app if there was a better way to access channels by gesture it would be very beneficial. 

My blind friend received notification of software update. App became unusable because she can’t see where to press in the notification box to remove the notification and begin using the app. Either don’t have the notification appear or give a gesture to accept or dismiss the notification to begin using the app. 

Pause button too close to channel bar. Accidental press too easy. 

This is a wonderful app and amazing technology but there are several improvements that would actually help blind people.",2018-05-18 09:48:28
Seeing AI,We hope to support the application of the Arabic language as soon as it contains many benefits,2018-05-17 17:39:17
Seeing AI,"I would recommend this app to anyone who is completely blind, or low vision like me. The best parts of this app for me are it’s ability to read short text on the fly, or capture entire documents in just a few seconds. This app rivals paid apps like DigitEyes and KNFBReader. I can’t speak for KNFBReader as I don’t own that app, but SeeingAI, in my experience, detects products just as good or even better than DigitEyes, as for it’s recognition of text on paper or a computer screen, I’ve not had any complaints about it. Things that need improvement are the money reader, scene recognition, and color recognition. Those features are relatively new, so I expect them to improve with updates. The app gets a five star recommendation from me, for anyone with even a slight visual impairment.",2018-04-19 17:45:58
Seeing AI,"I use this app regularly to read computer screens when I do not have access to JAWS or another screen reader.  I used to use an app called KNFB Reader, but this app seems to do a better job.  If Seeing AI supported reading PDF files, I would no longer need the KNFB Reader app.",2018-03-14 11:34:28
Seeing AI,"Very useful app
Please allow Israeli AppStore for blind users 
Thanks a lot",2018-03-08 02:40:59
Seeing AI,Absolutely love this app! Didn’t even think there was apps out here like this until today when I was on the phone with a friend. She told me that some of her friends use it and I had never heard of it. Only problem I have is with the face recognition… The age it gives you in face descriptions is way off. For example I  used a photo of my boyfriend earlier that was in my camera roll and had it describe the photo. It said he was 35 based on facial looks. I might not see very well but I know my boyfriend is only 23 and doesn’t look nowhere near that old… That need some improving other than that the app is amazing! Thank you!,2018-02-14 18:07:18
Seeing AI,"Simply magical! 

Please include the ability to import images of documents. 😁",2018-02-05 17:50:42
Seeing AI,"Sir, I have updated the review. The app is working flawlessly after the latest application update 🙂 and I'll consider updating the firmware in the near future. But right now the app is working full time. I'm giving 5 stars. Keep it up Microsoft 🙂",2018-01-31 05:07:40
Seeing AI,"Fantastic support. A must for every blind or low vision user.  Replaces a dozen apps I used to handle challenges we face every day.

I had some issues after updating to iOS 11.2.5 that Support was able to address and resolve.

Thanks Microsoft!",2018-01-30 18:57:33
Seeing AI,"I see so many possibilities for this app. It’s very user friendly. My 5 year old nephew loved the People part and was taking pictures of everyone! When showing it to colleagues, they immediately planned on installing it for their elderly parents. Office Lens is a little more accurate for full document reading, but the short text works great! I often recommend it and use it myself, even though I’m not visually impaired. The development team is amazing and responsive to feedback. Way to go!",2018-01-29 16:15:47
Seeing AI,I got a chance to test this app and it works great!,2018-01-26 03:27:06
Seeing AI,"as a blind person I cannot begin to tell you how convenient this app makes things from identifying money,  getting cooking instructions off of products helping to identify scenes around you, I have even used it during computer issues to diagnose what’s on my screen,  it’s very stable which anyone that uses VoiceOver knows that’s saying a lot, LOL definitely a well thought out app never thought I would be able to Denna five photos the way I have even points out famous people if it recognizes them and breeds of animals to try to give you a better description of the photo awesome job thank you very much",2018-01-25 08:32:06
Seeing AI,"This utility is awesome in its capabilities—OCR, identifies items, recognizes handwriting, colors, barcodes, and more.  What a handy app to have on my iPhone.  Thanks, Microsoft!",2018-01-23 18:46:53
Seeing AI,"I use this app for tons of stuff!
No more KNFB Reader!.  It helps me with clothing selection with colors, I spot-check my mail with short text so I don’t have to sit down with Kurzweill until I know it’s not JUNK!  I can use Document for obvious stuff, and the Product for re organizing my kitchen cabinet & putting away GROCERIES—It isn’t as up to date as an I.D. Mate, but it isn’t $1200 either!!
I even use it to see if I get the TV on when I get lost in the TV vs. Cable-box or Apple TV fight.  I EVEN use it to see if I have any BIOS POST errors, or to see if Windows is UPDATING or such when my PCs take forever to BOOT!  Needs some flourishes to be added, and I have a few suggestions, (already sent in!) but I try and get ev’body to think of and find new ways to use this app.

Microsoft— if you need a Rep / Presenter to travel to conventions, Here I Am!",2018-01-21 04:56:07
Seeing AI,How do you get Siri to open the program?  She keeps telling me I don't have that installed.,2018-01-06 10:14:52
Seeing AI,"This app is such a game changer in terms of the high level of quality accessibility that is being offered for free. This is awesome especially for students, who would not be able to afford high-priced apps to do some of these things that Microsoft is offering at no charge. Great job… Two thumbs up! Keep up the great work!",2017-12-21 20:45:06
Seeing AI,Thank you for such a wonderful app!,2017-12-21 15:20:38
Seeing AI,"The OCR on this app is outstanding. Much more accurate than the others I have tried. And so versatile! I had a Pen Friend I was using to label products in the kitchen. Don’t need that anymore. This app not only tells you what the product is from reading the barcode, it can also give you package information such as directions for preparation. Are use it to read signs in the hallways of buildings and on the street. And I can freeze frame text in a video and read that, too. I literally use it every single day. Thank you, Microsoft!",2017-11-26 16:25:35
Seeing AI,This app shows that Microsoft is really working hard towards changing its culture and bringing more empathy among themselves. The products like Seeing AI is a step in right direction to show the world the power of AI and how it can play a positive role in human lives and in this case it can really help visually impaired people to be independent. Great job!!,2017-10-20 13:46:32
Seeing AI,This app is very useful.,2017-10-17 22:27:21
Seeing AI,works well with voiceover,2017-09-30 04:23:37
Seeing AI,Remember the days of standalone scanning machines and the minutes we had to wait for each single page of error filled  readings. This app is nothing short of miraculous and it's ability to read in real Time with 99% accuracy is nothing short of miraculous. Thank you Microsoft keep up the good work! If you could add Hebrew  as a language that would be much appreciated,2017-09-24 10:51:58
Seeing AI,"I've never found a bar code reader app that worked reliably until now.  I tested it on cans, small bottles, and plastic packages, which are notorious for not reading well.  It worked every time.  Love the scene beta feature, too.  Tons of potential there.  Haven't had a chance to try that one outside too much, but everything I've asked it to identify inside, it's been right on the money.",2017-09-23 16:21:34
Seeing AI,"I am not blind, but I always love to see new technology. This app is, for lack of a better word, amazing. It can recognize people once you enter their face into its memory. It reads barcodes and tells you what the product is, and it can read written or printed text. And it's free! Thanks MS for making a great product.",2017-09-19 22:11:41
Seeing AI,Now we need glasses with a camera and speaker to go with this ap. Would make it so much easier to capture the text and bar codes. Especially for those who had sight . Please consider?,2017-09-07 07:48:34
Seeing AI,This is an awesome app the only problem I have with it is that it does not have a setting to recognize currency. I have tried recognizing dollar bills with this app and I haven't been able to make it work.,2017-08-21 10:52:12
Seeing AI,"so easy to use! 
I've been able to read vending machine info,  My t-shirts,  train station signs and info,  and train numbers on the train as it is pulling into the station. 

The app easily reads touch screens  and button panels,.  There now needs to be a way to match button text with a particular button on the panel.  This is easier with a large vending machine,  harder with an appliance such as a radio or washing machine.  

If someone wears glasses they have to put their picture in twice with and without the glasses. 

It would be awesome if the sceens app could report relavent information such as an empty seat,  trash can, vending machine,  all the things you want to find when using public transportation and facilities.",2017-08-18 02:44:02
Seeing AI,"Unable to download app
It seems to be downloading now so it may have been something wrong with either your system or mine that day. Thanks for responding.",2017-08-17 06:36:30
Seeing AI,"This app is very useful to help individuals to be independent, In all its features.
I must say the only criticism I can think of at this time is the person recognition option definitely requires more research and development to be more effective in its functions.
It is definitely great and fun during parties, in the way it is at this time.",2017-08-14 23:38:58
Seeing AI,"Hello:

I am a totally blind person who thoroughly enjoys using the Seeing AI app. Just a quick note to let you know that I absolutely love the Seeing AI app. I absolutely love it's many features, and it is truly a life-changing app. I use the short text feature when I want to find out who may have sent me mail, or if I want to find out something about a flyer or something like that. I also really enjoy using the product feature where I can read information about everything from bags of skittles to chips and other things such as canned goods. Your app as all the other readers of it's type completely beaten. Once again, I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work. I'm a fan for life.",2017-08-14 17:56:25
Seeing AI,"It's amazing when something comes along that just works, and in the short  Time I been using this it has become my go to app for any reading or barcode scanning etc. – please add a color reader to the channels and make this the most amazing app I have on my iPhone. Thank you Microsoft!",2017-08-13 16:38:35
Seeing AI,"Ever since day one when I downloaded this app, I've known I'd write a review, but kept forgetting. so today when I needed to identify my debit card and used Seeing AI to do just that, I stopped everything to write this review. thank you, Microsoft! 

the short text option has been wonderful for quickly sorting unopened mail, and the document reader has been fabulous for reading mail. I've used the app to quickly identify food items and the best part? A cookbook I have that my mom made for me before she died that that other OCR app couldn't read. I can now read my mom's old recipes. Thank you, thank you Microsoft!",2017-08-10 11:40:18

Seeing AI,The OCR and Barcode reader are absolutely amazing,2017-08-05 13:25:53
Seeing AI,Update: current version keeps crashing. Have to restart after every task. So grateful for this new technology. It really does work and has improved how I do many tasks throughout the day.,2017-08-04 15:16:58
Seeing AI,"This app beats the KNFB reader hands down. With KNFB reader you have to constantly be hitting that field of view report button to get the relative position. Seeing AI lets me leave the document I'm scanning in one place while I adjust the camera angle. Once all four corners of the page are in the camera lens, it takes the picture and eliminates guesswork. The text recognition is not perfect, but still much better than any other OCR app I've used.",2017-08-04 15:13:15
Seeing AI,Done right from the very beginning. An invaluable tool. Love it. Thank you for your incredible contribution to the blind community.,2017-07-29 07:57:53
Seeing AI,"In response to Larrykkk.    After talking to microsoft support, I got no  help as to why I had no product feature on my 5s phone, they did not have an answer. I went to a meeting of fellow blind people and they had the answer. The processor on the 5s will not suppor all of the features. 
 You must have iphone versions SE, 6 or 7 to be fully supported.  still a great app, thanks microsoft.",2017-07-25 11:48:55

Seeing AI,This app works fine on my iPad Air 2 but not my iPhone 5s. What are the hardware requirements?,2017-07-23 12:45:45
Seeing AI,"I just attempted to use this app for the first time, and I think it's quite good. As some have indicated, the document reader could use a little improvement, but many of the other features work rather well. I enjoyed the feature where you can scan a product via it's barcode. It would be nice if there were an option where you could scan a credit card to receive information on it, such as expiration date and the three digits on the back of the card. But overall, this app is wonderful. Thanks Microsoft!",2017-07-22 12:48:42
Seeing AI,"This is a huge step in accessibility. There are other apps but they're usually abandoned.
There is an issue when using it though. When active the phone heats a lot and the battery gets drained quite fast, 10 percent in les than 5 minutes.",2017-07-21 07:12:45

Seeing AI,The only consumer app so far that deserves to be called AI,2017-07-15 16:48:04
Seeing AI,"I am truly amazed with this app and the many embedded options.  Most free or minimal cost apps don't have consistent OCR identification accuracy, however this app puts most if not all which fall in the afore mentioned category to shame.  It is greatly appreciated.  Two things I would recommend is a text size control and a highlight rectangle when reading for those with low vision.  Great job Microsoft, I look forward to seeing new revisions of the software in the future.",2017-07-15 14:48:32
Seeing AI,"I am not blind (and thank goodness), merely have failing sight.  But I cannot imagine being completely sightless and being able to utilize this app for anything.  The periodic pop up warnings and tutorial screens give NO auditory alerts.  So I could picture it being endlessly frustrating for someone who couldn't see the screen.  

That being said, this is an interesting display of advancements in AI visual interpretation.  It does recognize certain things, and even read a pill bottle label to me.",2017-07-15 08:38:43

Seeing AI,Could not get it to read any text out loud.,2017-07-14 18:13:00
Seeing AI,"this app is the best all in one computer vision for the blind there is. I was sitting in a car and pointing the camera out the window and it was reading the signs. I used the scene recognition on myself and it said ""man with brown hair, wearing sunglasses,  taking a selfy"". I also was looking at wrinkled papers in the car on my lap and the ocr was almost perfect. I also love that it takes only a few seconds to find the barcode where as with other apps, it takes me 5-10 minutes. The best part, this is free!!! Microsoft, even though Windows 10 is terrible and you don't user test the surface pro with blind people, this puts your rating back to positive. This is one of the most amazing apps to have come out for blind people. thank you!",2017-07-14 08:02:09

Seeing AI,"This app is truly amazing. First drive was more than I could have imagined.  It's fast, intuitive and snappy.

You are all amazing!",2017-07-13 10:10:23

Seeing AI,"I was excited to see the introduction of the app particularly for a family member. However it needs a bit of work. I found the app to be buggy. Specifically, each of the channels did not begin translation immediately. In fact, I had to re-launch the app multiple times before automatic translation would begin on the each channel. Also the app crashed several times in my less than one day of use.",2017-07-13 09:15:28
Seeing AI,This is just amazing. I can't think of a more purposeful application.,2017-07-13 04:51:30
Seeing AI,"Very good at doing so many things and a fun way to play around with image detection AI!  Barcode reader is the best one I've ever used. Face detection seems extremely well implemented, I was able to quickly take a nicely framed up selfie using the back camera and the audio cues from the app. It tells you the subject's gender, age, and mood.  And then there's the scene detection where you take a picture and it does its best to describe what it sees. It's not always accurate but it's usually pretty close, and sometimes it can come up with some interesting feedback. 

Everything feels VERY snappy, at least on my iPhone 7 Plus on my home WiFi. The voice is so responsive and quick that using the app feels almost futuristic at times. This is the main thing that differentiates this from things I've seen before. It feels a bit like an Apple product— none of these AI technologies is new, but it's the first time they are all together in one accessible place and so well executed. 

The only thing that didn't work for me was the document detection feature, I tried many times to scan a receipt on A4 paper from an online purchase and it appeared to recognize the geometry of the paper very well and quickly asked me to hold still but then said there wasn't any text found while displaying a black screen where there would normally be an image. Apparently a minor bug which I hope they'll hammer out in the next release. 

I truly believe this app will help many people with vision impairment. Thank you for your hard work on making something great!",2017-07-13 03:21:04
Seeing AI,"Amazing  with reading text, I love that its in real time, and clear. but it has a hard time reading darker skin tones and short hair, I tested this app with three friends and we  all had a hard time, being mu medium brown to pale, with are hair from long to super short, it wuld give us boy if our hair was back, and 10 years older if we were darker or were holding our hair back.",2017-07-13 02:37:00
Seeing AI,"I was suspicious of this app, especially given its early release in its lifecycle.  I can definitely say that it impressed me in very short order with its capacity to visually recognize a myriad of scenarios and make very accurate statements based on what is seen. 
It conjures up what hot dog/not hot dog from Silicon Valley should have been.",2017-07-12 23:11:08

Seeing AI,"I literally fell in love with this app, how quickly it computes and reads off information and words in real-time... The creators of this app should be really proud of themselves. The one problem I have with this is the cancel ""x"" buttons. I'm not blind, but I found it hard to hit the ""x"" button. I feel like there could be a bother or better option to cancel the photo by, say, shaking the phone, double-tapping, etc. I think this app will go a long way!",2017-07-12 20:03:36

Seeing AI,"Thanks to Microsoft! This is something which I have dreamed about for years. I am particularly impressed with the facial recognition feature. If Microsoft continues research in this direction, then I will be a regular customer of Microsoft. As one who is visually impaired, I am eternally grateful to Microsoft.",2017-07-12 18:47:32
Seeing AI,"Pros
It reads shampoo and conditioner bottles and other plastic bottles with flat surface.

Seeing AI,Not sure how a blind person is supposed to operate this app which requires you to see in order to operate using the onscreen buttons.,2017-07-12 18:25:46
Seeing AI,This app is awesome and I as a totally blind person can appreciate what Microsoft is doing. But it is a battery killer. Still I was able to read a few weeks worth of mail and was able to reapply us to something that I had not even known we were removed from so good job Microsoft but there is definitely room for improvement.,2017-07-12 12:10:06
Seeing AI,"Not much to say, I am speechless. Download it and experience it for yourself. Highly recommend you watch the videos on YouTube. I am in love #RealLove. For some odd reason on the YouTube video it does show money recognition but on the download that feature is still not available, can't wait for that to be available also can't wait for color  recognition.",2017-07-12 11:59:09
Seeing AI,"Unlike previous attempts at barcode scanning, this app is doing a great job of finding the code without needing to be placed precisely on it. It didn't actually know what a few of my foods were, but switching to short text recognition gave me enough info to sort it out quickly. Having both options in one app is wonderful. As for the facial recognition, the jury is still out. With my first picture it guessed I was ten years older than I am, so I'm waiting for it to apologize. It did improve with better lighting, thank goodness!",2017-07-12 11:58:19

Seeing AI,"Little improvements that could go a long way. I'm an optician who advised this app to a client of mine. Just concerned that the text and icons are too small/non-distinct to navigate for someone with very little sight. Also when scanning a document sometimes you would not want all the information to be read out.

Ideas for future development:

2. QR reader
3. Ability to describe scenes on screenshots from websites / photos already in phone memory.",2019-05-04 02:09:12

Seeing AI,I use this app every day and would not like to be without it.  I am always surprised with the speed of the short text facility.  Also I really like that it is able to make a good attempt with handwriting.  I am slightly disappointed with colour recognition though I am sure this will improve.  Can’t thank the developers enough.,2018-02-27 07:17:05
Seeing AI,"... useful for those of us with limited sight. Did some basic testing, and it’s not perfect, but what is? 😉

Wasn’t great with the colours, but I suspect that’s because the light was too bright from the phone, and it was bouncing-off reflections of that light, making darker colours appear brighter, or altering the colour detected completely.

For those of us with NO colour vision, this would likely cause issues, but I usually get family to help me when needed 👍.

The product ID worked on the 3 products I tested, it was flawless 😀.

The text/document test was ok, but as usual for these talking apps, I had to slow it down to make it more legible.

Overall, a very useful app, but needs work in some areas 😊👍.",2018-02-20 08:56:03

Seeing AI,"Very infrequently does an app come along which can have a real impact on improving the day-to-day lives of visually impaired people, many have tried and often don’t succeed.

Since it’s first launch in the UK Seeing AI has become a permanent fixture on my home screen for the main reason that it is helpful. As a visually impaired person, simple tasks such as reading product labels atop shelves In a large store can become both a complicated and embarrassing experience; however, with Seeing AI’s short text channel it becomes much easier to independently find what I’m looking for. Meanwhile, the document channel can be very useful if there is a printed page to read, I have found a relative consistency in the accuracy of the scanning and for standard printed documents it has proved to be very accurate on many occasions. Version 2 has also brought a number of enhancements such as multiple currency recognition and colour detection, which could be really useful for some people.

As of right now, Seeing AI isn’t ‘perfect’ as there are still some enhancements and needed improvements concerning factors especially regarding the ability to read different types of text, such as on a destination display board or picking out information with busy documents such as a restaurant Menu. However, Seeing AI has a great team of committed people behind them and have already made significant usability enhancements such as the use of 3D Touch on newer iPhone models to quickly reach a desired channel quickly.

Overall, for anyone who has a visual impairment Seeing AI is more than just a worthwhile download. It is a genuinely useful mobility aid, which in some cases is able to allow more tasks to be undertaken independently. Whilst there are still some improvements and enhancements which can be made to improve the experience, for the price of nothing there is no reason not to give Seeing AI a chance.",2018-01-15 04:53:49

I contacted the support team via e-mail and I did not find a solution to these problems yet. The answer i got is the reading limit is  set to make sure our servers don't overload depending on the language selected.
Your answer proves that there are a large number of users who benefit from your application, and this limit you have made the application not as useful as before.  
Why don't you increase the number of servers or improve their performance?
Why didn't you think about this step before you decided to make the app free?  And what is the fault of the people who paid to benefit from the application and now they suffer from these limits in using it?

Envision AI,"First, thanks to the developers of envision AI for staying so engaged with the user community and constantly making the app better. It is really a valuable tool! My favorite thing about this app is the document scanner. It is by far the most accurate OCR I’ve ever experienced on my iPhone. A couple years ago I purchased something called KNFB reader which if I recall was like $100 and it cannot compete with envision OCR. The instant text feature can be very useful but I feel it also has room for further development. It continuously re-scans what you are aiming it at, sometimes resulting in garbled output, and it constantly cuts off and interrupts its own output even if you barely move your phone. It’s really a game of seeing if you can make out what it says well enough to at least accomplish the task. For example, if I aim it at a carton that I pull out of the fridge and I hear something that sounds similar to “milk” or “half-and-half,” I know what I’ve just grabbed, but I really think it could work a lot more smoothly. I have a suggestion – somehow combine the object recognition and instant text technologies such that the instant text reader has some awareness of what you are pointing it at. In my milk carton example, it would know that it’s reading within the bounds of that object which might help it focus. Along similar lines, I have a heck of a time getting it to read LCD screens on home appliances and electronics. I wish there was a way you could tell it to recognize an LCD screen and have it only focus on text that appears on that screen. This is a suggestion I made a while back and it hasn’t been implemented yet, but I can’t imagine others wouldn’t find it helpful. Giving it five stars because overall I still think it’s outstanding, but I hope to see it continue to improve. Thank you",2022-07-30 15:01:09

Envision AI,"So I always wanted an app where I didn’t have to read my documents and where I could just leave them with the voice doing it, but now we have the opportunity to do that because of this good app",2021-12-04 22:07:34
Envision AI,"this app is amazing. It does everything in a great way. it is easy to use, well-organized, feature rich, and offer great value for money. I rely on it daily to scan documents and read them accessibly, recognize objects, and read screens.",2021-11-08 00:41:24
Envision AI,"The most recent app update will take away your lifetime subscription. I have had one since 2018 and now I am being forced to purchase another subscription. Please fix or negative review will stay here.
The team contacted me via email and told me how to fix my lifetime subscription. I am still going to giving three stars because this shouldn’t happen.",2021-08-16 10:39:54
Envision AI,I loved this program until they did their update yesterday. Now it refuses to stay open and crashes every time I try to open it. I have unloaded it from my phone and reloaded it with sadly the same result. It is incredibly frustrating as I am dependent upon this program to read the number on my continuous glucose meter sensor when I have to change them. Please fix whatever the problem is so that I can use it again. Thank you,2021-07-26 12:24:41

Envision AI,"several other apps share some of the features of Envision. However, only Envision has them all. It is my go to scanning app these days. Even better, I have the glasses, which really broaden my view of the world, so to speak, as someone who is totally blind.",2021-04-27 05:27:22
Envision AI,All the updates are done to the app and you’re paying $4000 for app updates. I just bought the Envision glasses and most of the features are not on fillable on them.,2021-03-16 05:57:24
Envision AI,"I didn’t realize this was an app for the vision impaired when i downloaded it, i was just looking for an OCR app to be able to copy and read aloud documents or notes.  I started messing around with the app when i figured it out and it’s insane how helpful this app is!  If i knew anyone that was vision impaired i would recommend this, though since i am not vision impaired (outside of having to wear glasses) i cant say it’s perfect because i don’t know for certain. It does make me happy though, it’s like a metal detector for colors, people, objects, and scenes which is probably super useful for the vision impaired!",2021-01-31 19:12:15
Envision AI,"The app does an excellent job in multilingual documents. It is very promising. The instant read and handwriting needs some improvement. The front panel is a little confusing. It took me several minutes to discover that importing images and files is hidden in a submenu. Nonetheless, the app is developing rapidly, and for this it deserves five points.",2020-12-09 19:01:07
Envision AI,This application is brought back my independence. Thank you so much.! I would love to see the option for currency reading. Aside from that it is great to be able to read my mail on my own and products inside my home as well.,2020-09-20 00:32:53
Envision AI,"I really do appreciate the hard work of the developers put into this app. It is similar to Seeing AI, but in my opinion this app does better on certain things then seeing AI, and seeing AI does things better then envision. InVision doesn't really tell me what's outside of a window. It does advertise this, but I pointed the camera outside of a window and it just says a blue and gray window, or something similar. Take a picture of my watch? A white watch. Take a picture of the TV with a movie playing? A greay television sitting on top of a desk. Not sure what the issue is on that one. I do like the extra feedback that I get, Such as the color of an item and whether it's sitting on a desk. I don't understand why login is required. I just Rihanna a free trial for 14 days and don't understand what the login is for.",2020-07-22 09:44:30
Envision AI,And the latest version of this app each time I scan a barcode no matter what it is it will tell me that the barcode is not recognized. I even tried to reinstall the app. The latest version is also very sluggish with voiceover. This needs to be fixed or I would like my money back.,2020-06-19 16:45:25
Envision AI,"I absolutely love this app, its instant, perfect, and everything I need! Thank you for creating this masterpiece!",2020-05-21 10:44:46

Envision AI,Hoping that their is a money reader added to this application,2019-11-09 14:37:51
Envision AI,"As an idea and a wonderful implementation, but the most correct mistakes were not exactly so",2019-11-05 16:22:03
Envision AI,"When I install an app, I want to be given a choice whether and when to start a limited time free trial, and for contact info to be easily accessible without requesting a call back. None of this was able to happen. As soon as I set up, my 14 day free trial was under way with no way to stop it. That kind of aggressiveness earns a spot on my permanent ban list. In that area Envision AI has succeeded. Be careful when installing if you are not quite ready. Your countdown begins immediately. In my world, not good business practice.",2019-10-30 18:03:07
Envision AI,"I purchased this app a few months back after trying it for a month and really liked it. However, Within the past month, the changes made have made the app useless. It no longer  says what edges aren't visible so that I can move it in the correct direction to get the full image. Secondly, the text is now not viewable by flicking through the screen. You have to wait for it to read it, so getting instructions off a box for cooking is tedious. I didn't checkto see if it would read word by word, but who wants to do that when trying to  Prepare something?Thirdly, when I went to stop my auto payment, the options of subscriptions  are not read. I had to click on one of the unread items and then since I happened to click on the one I already subscribed too, it mentioned this fact and other info. I was then able to click the manage button and successfully unsubscribe. Until this app improves, I will not reccommend it to anyone. I was using IOS 12 last month and IOS 13 in the past few days, IOS isn't the  issue. I'm using an iphone 8 and have been for the past couple years. I hope you improve this app back to one that is as good or even better than the one I used when purchasing the subscription.",2019-10-17 07:23:37
Envision AI,"Thank you for this great app. It's even better than seeing AI. Keep up your great job.
It reads the computer screen very well, very useful to us when there's no screen reader available. It would be great to make the app detect the item or the option under the curser.
It will be great to control which languages it should read. Sometimes it reads languages other than the language displayed. i.e. it fails to recognize the correct language.
It is great that it recognizes Arabic, but the quality needs to improve more and more, because sometimes the text is clear but the app fails to recognize the correct letter.",2019-09-05 12:34:15
Envision AI,"unlike seeing ai, this app is not created by the monopoly Microsoft, and actually works. It successfully scans QR codes without saying product not found. Color detection works great and text reading works great.

only two things I would suggest, is adding a Money Reader function, and a light  detector..  also, I noticed the scan QR code function, it will read a barcode, but then to read another one, you have to close the app entirely, and re-open it back up again to read another barcode. Also if it doesn’t detect the barcode for some unknown reason it doesn’t tell you it’s just stop scanning for one after about five seconds, so you have to hit scan QR code again, wait for it,, sometimes it detects it sometimes it doesn’t. If it doesn’t then you have to exit the app again and open the app back up again. If you have no idea  where the barcode  is at,  this is a bad thing because if you can’t see the QR code,  the app doesn’t give you enough time to locate where the barcode is at. at times out at literally five seconds and that’s not near long enough. But once you can get it to scan, it does detect the code correctly.

I took advantage of the August summer sale even though I am without an income right now, but figured it was worth the sacrifice for such a great app. It has so much potential for the future as well that I couldn’t pass up the deal.",2019-08-31 10:24:52
Envision AI,A request of mine would be to add a describer that will describe a particular photo on your phone and read the text and the photo has text but I hope to see this soon but accurately,2019-08-09 20:46:50
Envision AI,I use this app every single day. Are used to use Seeing AI or a lot of other different apps and other devices like Orcam and E Sight. But I have found is this app actually takes the place of almost all of them! I am waiting for these guys to find a pair of smart glasses that will support their app on them! When are you guys going to put your app on a pair of smart glasses? I know you looked into views explains? Have you looked into the X2  by Third Eye Generation? I think you guys would partner quite nicely and they are quite inexpensive and allow for many different apps to go onto their App Store. I think I can’t wait for the partnership or at least with some other type of glasses because I am tired of hanging my phone from my neck to use your app all the time the facial recognition really doesn’t work well that way and I think you guys would be amazing in a pair of glasses and tent to some developer out there!!!,2019-06-04 12:19:49
Envision AI,I love it. I'm blind and I love how easy it is to use. Amazing job!!!!,2019-04-05 06:52:48
Envision AI,I’m a user of seeing ai but I found this app and wanted to check it out because I know a lot of people who use android that would benefit greatly from this app and it’s available on Android unlike seeing ai so I was excited when I found it because I thought finally the visually impaired android users I know can have the same kind of help I get on my iPhone however after getting the app I was sad to see it cost a monthly fee I understand you have to make money and it costs money to make and maintain the app I was just disappointed to see the fee because unlike this app seeing ai is completely free a lot of visually impaired people are on fixed income and may not be able to afford the fee I know one man in particular who could really use this app his vision is almost as bad as mine and I use seeing ai daily but I also know he can’t afford the fee other than that this seems like a great app you all did a great job with it and I thank you for finally making an app like seeing ai that is available for android,2019-04-02 21:23:04
Envision AI,"The app is great in many areas. However, I don’t recommend that users should purchase an annual or life time licence for now as it seems that the developer is still having issues with it. I have been contacting the developer regarding really fatal bugs and the slow responses and lack of clear answers to questions made me reconsider buying the life time licence and reflect on requesting a refund for the annual licence I have already purchased. I send emails to the developer and it takes almost 5 days to get a response. The updates have not addressed any of the bugs. Don’t buy at this stage, either you wait or buy monthly plans. For my wonder, the developer has recommended that I may use Android app instead to deal with the issues I am having with the app! Thanks all.",2019-03-22 16:52:19

Envision AI,"But... Seeing AI is free for iOS devices. And is Envision AI’s main ‘competition’. I get it though, not every company can afford making free apps (like Microsoft can). That said, the prices are fair. 
I like everything else so far, and I’m sure it’ll get better and better with each update.",2018-11-14 09:20:41

Envision AI,A very nice app,2018-05-23 18:25:52
Envision AI,The quick document reader is 50 times slower than Seeing ai. Plus I have a free trial but I can't find what the cost is when the trial ends.  That just seems sneaky and I want more honesty.,2018-05-12 10:12:49

Envision AI,This has been my go-to app the last few weeks because of its accuracy in reading text. I prefer this over seeing ai but that works only for folks who want use this the app in English. Envision AI works in German too which is my 2nd language. I love that the developers are taking the effort to do this! Worth the subscription!,2018-02-10 09:41:40
Envision AI,I'm pretty impressed with this app. It reads things pretty clear. Keep up the good work.,2017-10-25 21:41:41
Envision AI,"Is there no choice of voices? 

This definitely works, but the pronunciation is so far off for some words it’s as if the app doesn’t recognise the word. Also, it’s reading more of the document than is shown on my screen, making it very difficult to know where to point the camera. And it reads out the punctuation which just renders the document incomprehensible. 

So it gets 2 stars - works, is easy to use. 
But voice is terrible, hearing the punctuation is nonsense unless I wanted to write an accurate copy of what is being read to me (and why would I?). Not being able to tell where it’s about to start reading, when it’s reading off the screen, isn’t at all useful.",2024-11-01 00:13:11

Envision AI,"Not at all impressed.  I downloaded this app on the basis it has now become free, and I will be deleting it just as quickly.  While the scanning function is good, features such as the person recognition is completely useless, even with a camera pointed directly at someone it failed to see that tere was someone there. Am yet to try the barcode scanner but I definitely would never have paid for this app.",2022-07-24 00:51:52
Envision AI,"This app is fantastic!
I just got my dads hospital discharge letter which was folded up in my pocket, unfolded it and scanned it while holding the letter roughly in my hand. The app quickly scanned and analyses the letter that was full of technical information and in a table format. The app reformatted the document and presented it as reformatted plain text on the screen and got it 100% correct and totally readable. I tried the same with seeing AI and KNFB reader and they didn’t know what the duck they were looking at I even spread the white document out on the floor which is dark and neither seeing AI or KNFB reader had a clue!! The only issue is that this app tells me that it’s the 14 day evaluation copy which means at some point you must have to pay for it and I can’t find anywhere where they say how much it costs!",2019-12-24 06:18:30

Supersense - AI for Blind,"Over the past few weeks, I’ve been trying to look for a Camera app that supplied all my needs like this one. This application does everything that I wanted it to. I mean, exactly everything I was expecting. Thank you so much for working hard to make this app. I’d like it if you could add some new updates to the app. You know. Add some new features at least. But you don’t have to. It’s just a suggestion. Once again thank you so much for working hard to make this app. PS I’d recommend it to any blind ones out there who is looking for an app. This app I’d highly recommend. It’s free. Some features are premium. But it’s free.",2022-01-05 18:45:41

Supersense - AI for Blind,"Got the lifetime subscription for 50% off holiday sale, have been enjoying this app so far, given that my school blocks access to Seeing AI and most of the channels are restricted with Seeing AI, able to recognize multi page documents, wish it had a PDF OCR converter, but this app has extra perks such as currency and explore options, exploring options are referring to object recognition/identifiers, there’s also category specific look ups, you can select kitchen and start scanning and the camera will detect anything related to the category selected, The best function of this app is smart scanning, with this mode, all reading categories are selected, AI can detect what you’re trying to scan.  but there are several issues with this app, when opening the menu button to go to subscription options and other options, the back  buttons is not labeled with voiceover, also, when you try to purchase a second subscription on a different device, it will say you have already subscribed to this subscription, I don’t like the fact that it does not allow you to manually snap a document, everything is done automatically, wish there could be a manual picture mode for reading documents, but I do understand why the quick read functionality will not have a snap picture button, but I wish the document and multi document channels allow for manual picture scanning, also, Text that have previously been read should not be repeated when the phone is not held study,  also, sometimes when scanning using the quick read channel, there seems to be a lot of gibberish when scanning small text such as the model number of the CD player, the way to fix it is to have a manual capture option because when I used voice dream scanner, there was not as much gibberish because you have the option to manually take pictures. And lastly, I suggest that the app should have multi language document scanning functionality for premium users",2021-12-22 01:51:10

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I have been using this app for about three months now. I find it to be very user-friendly. It goes above and beyond what you see from similar apps like Seeing AI and Envision. Yes, you do have to purchase a subscription, but I think that it is totally worth it. The smart scan feature is awesome because it is intuitive and allows you to read or recognize a multitude of things without having to change between features. I especially love the barcode scanner. I find it to be very helpful and I love that you don’t have to manually go back a screen to scan the next barcode. You can just keep scanning product after product and getting results every time. I highly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or visually impaired.

I like the feature when I read the text to you it tells you where to position the phone so it captures all the text is so quick and fast.

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I have used this app for some time and it usually ends up being more of an exercise in frustration than an actual help. It may work better for reading a page of nicely formatted text, but it doesn’t work at all for helping to read a paper that I need to read and sign. The understanding of what sections of the page come next seldom works, and it tends to chop off words at each side of the paper - even after telling me to “move further away from the page” until there is more than 1 inch background around each edge of the paper. Overall I have rarely been able to get it to correctly read a page even after months of trying.",2021-02-13 13:26:03

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I was using another app to scan cans and boxes when I’m cooking but this app was so much better because no matter where I scan it it starts reading instead of trying to find a barcode.
I haven’t tried the other features yet.
It is so helpful for cooking that I put it on my first screen so I could find it easy.",2021-01-16 15:06:44
Supersense - AI for Blind,"A good app and it’s priced for $49. It does a lot of the things that it’s competition does but in some aspects it does them better. I found the barcode section of the app very usable especially in grocery stores. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app once but it seems to be working like a charm. The app is quick fast and intuitive I have run it on an iPhone XS max as well as an iPhone 12 pro. Maybe as the developer said the state will reimburse me for the price of the app. I could not get myself to pull the trigger for $99, it was just too much money but because of the holiday sale I purchased it for $49. We will see if the price is worth it if the developers keep iterating on the app with new improvements. I know they’re free apps out there that do the same but I’m from the old-school, you get what you pay for. The best feature that this app or anyone can come out with is that the app would be able to read a touchscreen display such as on a laundry machine or vending machine, that’s the function everybody wants. I think a company that can make it happened will excite the entire visually impaired community.",2020-12-31 11:28:23

Supersense - AI for Blind,Most useful and important app I’ve ever seen for the blind! I cannot believe how useful it is and that I did not know about this before. Could not believe my eyes when I saw what it was telling me LOL not really… Blind of course!,2020-11-07 02:48:30
Supersense - AI for Blind,"Supersense is a great all in one tool for accessing many features in one app. My phone screen is scattered with various blindness apps to help me do something or another. An app for reading money, an app for just quickly reading something I found, another app for quickly importing and reading a picture from the share sheet, ETC. this app is nice in the sense that it combines these all together limiting my array of apps I juggle around on a daily bases. 
Probably my favorite and most used feature is how the scanned text is displayed. Instead of your traditional screen where it just reads you the hole page of text, and you have to switch to line navigation or something similar if you want to read individual parts. They break the text into blocks, and it is super fluent to read the exact parts you need. Not only that, but you can copy these blocks of text easily to your clipboard via the roader.
Now, one thing I see people are concerned about is the price. It is subscription based. You can purchase a monthly, yearly, or a lifetime subscription. I don’t have much else to say on that, other than if you are worried about the price, you can download and try it out for free. Also, if you maybe don’t have the money to afford the app, at the bottom of the subscription signup page, you will find the following message.
“You may qualify for a reimbursement for your subscription from a state organization. Tap to request assistance and we will reach out to you with additional information.”
I am not exactly sure who all that would apply to, but it sounds like they are willing to work with you to get you any help you need. I think that is really great of them, and speaks very highly of them as a company.",2020-10-16 17:35:31

There have been a couple of updates since then and decided to give SS A second try to see if it had improved any since the first time. However, it will not work now unless you pay. The least expensive option was about $60 per year at $4.99 Per month for a software which would not read a print letter that the actually free seeing AI app did actually read well.

As soon as he tries to use in when he’s alone he accidentally touches the screen in the wrong place ( T at the bottom or menu at the top ) this brings up text on the screen which he can not read as he is blind !!!
He has to use Siri to open the app but Siri won’t let him close the app to reset it, meaning someone with good sight has to do it for him (they could just read whatever he was trying to read at that point).

OneStep Reader,"I would happily pay $99 for the application that I'm looking for, but this is not it. I was hoping that I would be able to use this to read historical SEC filings of companies which include a lot of text and tables. Unfortunately, as their instructional material explains, Advance documents like memos in books are only intended for the cited users, while blind people are only supposed to read receipts. 

Even though it says that you can export to HTML, the only options for saving are PDF and some sort of proprietary format which they recommend for blind people. The only way that you can actually read is by using the audio player tool, as voiceover Will only navigate word by word. You can also only read by sentence, word or line, and not by paragraph. During the OCR process, voiceover will not interact with the application and it does not tell you the progress.

I wish there was a podcast on demonstrating or how to use this app. I think people would agree to pay the high cost if they could see or hear a demonstration of its use. That would even help me since I have purchased the app and still don’t know how to use it. that would drive up your sales, and help me at the same time. for example, instructions on how to use it, what you can use it to do, etc.",2019-03-07 04:33:05

OneStep Reader,In the past I have greatly appreciated the benefits of this application.

OneStep Reader,"I’d had this app for more than three years, and have really liked   it overall, even though I am a bit of a klutz.  However, with Version 3.0, it has become much more difficult to use, at least for this user.  For one thing, the new user manual isn’t very helpful; it tells us what the app can do, but doesn’t really tell us _how to do things. With this significant an update, giving us the how-to is extremely important. For instance, importing text from other sources used to be very straightforward—and it worked well.  Now, when I try to import something, I first have to find where the material _went.  At first, in this version, it went into a folder called “Inbox” (not even mentioned in the user manual).  With the latest update, however, “Inbox” is gone, and I have to search for it among the saved files, even though it technically hasn’t been saved yet.  Then, I have to go through all kinds of hoops to save the document in a form that will recognize the text.  Sometimes, the field of view report doesn’t work now.  The whole thing is just harder to use, especially if I am saving documents.  If the user manual were written from the viewpoint of a _new user, it would benefit all of us.  Prior to this, I would have given it a higher rating.
Update, Jan. 10, 2019: It just keeps getting worse. It still does reasonably well for reading and saving otherwise inaccessible material from websites; but, with iOS 12 and later, scanning documents such as books, magazines, and even mail is becoming less successful. Even reinstalling the app didn’t help. More often than not, the reading comes out Like gibberish now; the automatic picture function almost _never works, and the field of view report is frequently unavailable; at times, it says that the page is upside down when it isn’t; and, in fact, just about the only people who _might be able to benefit from scanning documents with it are sighted users who have different reading difficulties, such as dyslexia. Really, there should be one app for sightless users, and a different one for sighted users. That way, more focus could be given to having all features working and updated. I’m only keeping the three stars because of the ability to import text from otherwise inaccessible websites.",2019-01-09 22:57:47
OneStep Reader,This app has gotten much better and much more useful than it has been in the past and I like that. I look forward to seeing how much better this app will become.

OneStep Reader,"I don’t think that the recognition is getting any better in the last few releases. Also this application never completely leaves my system. Often times after leaving the application the level vibrator still continues to vibrate the phone. Even if I go into the app switcher and close it that way, I’ve got to restart my phone to get it to stop vibrating. Also in the most recent releases, it doesn’t go back to picture mode if there is no text. I personally find the new tab arrangement more difficult to work with than the original one. My old Nokia and 82 with one of the original versions, seems to still work better. I am using an iPhone 7.",2018-12-23 10:25:38

OneStep Reader,"I recently downloaded (AND PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR) this app to use for assistance in reading books. There seem to be so many poorly designed aspects of this app that are making it tedious to use.
1. When I photograph multiple pages and allow them to process, then try to add more images to the existing file, I can only do it one image at a time.
2. The automatic photo feature just does not work, period.
3. Half the time in manual photo mode using the volume buttons fails to work to take the photo, but at random times it does work.
4. If I photograph multiple images and allow them to process, then go straight into listening to them, the reading accuracy is much higher as the app reads directly from the photograph. However, if I close the app or switch files for too long the images convert into PDF-looking files and much of the text becomes gibberish.
5. The incessant refocusing in the camera app is frustrating because I have to try to time when I press the button, or else it takes a blurry photo.
6. Only one voice option.
7. Button symbols are bizarre and difficult to understand, I don't use any other text-to-voice converters so I only have the visual cues.
8. It is difficult to upload a file, I still cannot figure out how.

I've only had this app for four days and have already run into so many issues. Why does this cost $100 if it barely functions? I'm a poor grad student.",2018-11-18 11:45:46
OneStep Reader,Horrible. What happened to this app? For some reason I cannot change the English voice to anything but Fred. I am not impressed with the new user interface either. I can use it however it is not as straightforward as it use to be. it just seems cluttered. I agree with other reviewers  that   saving files and importing them is needlessly  more  complicated. My biggest complaint with this app is the fact that I can only use Fred using English. There is no way I would pay full price for this app now.,2018-11-11 16:56:09
OneStep Reader,"I miss the easy way you use to be able to access imported files from another app, it use to be that explorer was at the top of the screen and tapping on this instantly opened your imported file.  Also ever since IOS12 the app will throw you back to the home screen upon launching however it remains active, going to the app switcher and taping on it will put you right back at the home screen.
Other than that it is a very accurate app and I know yall willl fix the IOS12 issues",2018-10-13 10:03:06
OneStep Reader,Unreliable  needs lots of work,2018-09-24 07:22:45
OneStep Reader,"Many reviews have already pointed out the unreliability of the importing feature. For me, it sometimes doesn’t show up unless I go away from the files tab and come back to it. The fact that I keep getting asked if I want to save my document after I’ve exported it makes  the process really slow. So for example, I will open a document, press save, pick a name, file type, and location, hit save, and then try to open another file, and I will get asked if I want to save the current document without closing. That seems unnecessary. I should be able to switch between files either with them auto saving or the app trusting that if I am moving away from the document I’ve finished with it.
The app also seems to be slow to respond to some button press. In previous versions it would also say how many pages out of the total document it’s converted which was useful to know.
Also, the app is still not integrated with iCloud. This is my main cloud service and I keep having to email myself documents I already have just so I can import them from my email.
Also, more of an iPad feature but it would be great to be able to use the app in landscape mode which is as of now unavailable..
Lastly, smart invert. I am someone who likes to look at the interface of my screen and use voiceover to read the elements. Now, smart invert, that is extremely useful in every other app on my phone, turns the interface to light. I realize the app is already set up for contrast, but I shouldn’t have to turn off smart invert to use KNFB and turn it on for the rest of my phone. The reader view is slightly different because I can customize the text color and background color, but the rest of the interface is extremely uncomfortable for me to look at. A simple fix would be to double contrast the whole app instead of just the camera so that the theme stays consistently dark with the rest of my apps.
The actual OCR capabilities of the app work well but the user experience is far from perfect. As a student in college that paid the full price of the app, I should have no issues with this app. But for now I am sorry to say it is not worth the price.",2018-09-06 09:07:16
OneStep Reader,"I have not been able to get saved files to open and read and then close remaining unchanged.  It seems to modify everything I had saved if I open it to find out what it was.  There seems to be no way to close the file intact as it was without it being ""modified"" and changed in the date order, so that it is like a needle in the haystack to find again according to date it was first saved.  I don't want to modify what I saved by the simple act of opening it to read it.  It mostly doesn't seem to read a previously saved pdf that had obviously read easily in the past either. The OCR function which used to work rather straightforwardly like as in Kurzweil 1000, now is like a ""keepaway"" game.  It will only warn you that you can't change whatever it does to your saved image through this next attempt to get the app to recognize an image it once easily recognized.  Even if you don't choose to modify or save or even OCR what you've opened to just peek at with your ears like you could before, it becomes ""modified"" and it's search order is jumbled up as well as text that wasn't that jumbled before.  I never saved undecipherable files to begin with.  It is changing every file I open rendering it useless.  I used to be able to open it, and quickly find a file and use it on the street or in an appointment or meeting.  There's just no way to get that to happen now.  I've just spent hours here at home trying to sort out a way to use my files again, and it's just not working. I don't have hours to try to hope to retrieve anything on the go anymore.  I remember the first time I got the app maybe two December's ago how amazing and exciting it was to use in real time to read a menu, the first time out.  How I could find the first recipe I saved from a pdf!  I was so amazing.  It wasn't broken.  It didn't need to be fixed.

OneStep Reader,"The fact that such an app exists at all to help those of us who can’t see well enough to read print is worthy of three stars, so I am grateful we have this tool. That said, this behaves more like a free app than one I spent $100 on. First of all, where are the updates??? We are coughing up the money, so you should be providing frequent updates. My biggest issue with the app is trying to line up the shot when scanning a document. The phone vibrates wildly, which I gather is supposed to indicate whether or not it is being held at a level angle over the page, but I find this almost impossible to get just right and more annoying than helpful. Can’t alignment of the page be done electronically during image processing? Secondly, I wish it behaved like banking apps when you are taking a picture of a check for an electronic deposit. You simply hold the phone over the document and move it around a bit until it is lined up. Once it is aligned, the app automatically takes the picture for you and processing begins. For $100, why isn’t this app doing the same? The technology obviously exists. Instead, it is a tedious game of guess-and-check where I have to continuously press one of the volume buttons to get a status update on whether or not I am lined up. Even The motion of reaching to press this button makes it harder to steady the phone, so I never feel like I get a really good shot. These announcements should happen automatically. Finally, the documents generated, while often producing some readable text, usually also have a mess of garbled text and random symbols, making it very hard to find what you are looking for. I know the technology exists nowadays for OCR processing to work much more smoothly than this, and again, at the price you are asking, your app needs to be a lot better. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t have purchased this app and would have just settled for something free that basically gets the job done comparably well.  Many blind and visually impaired people are on fixed incomes, so taking a chance on something like this with no option of getting your money back is a big deal.",2018-04-14 10:29:36

OneStep Reader,Totally worth the price helps me everyday and can be used so many different ways,2018-01-10 13:15:31
OneStep Reader,"This is a great app for single-page scanning! With a couple fixes it could be great for multi-page scanning, too (more about that below).

Bought at $50 (50% off the regular $100 price), its OCR has proven very accurate and quick, amazing me at how it can accommodate automatically for slightly curved pages and such. I appreciate how you can add pages to existing files at any time. Thanks to the developers who continue to refine the app!

While it is over 90% there, it is too rough for a $50 app (let alone $100 at the regular price). Scanning a document over 35-40 pgs consistently causes the app to crash. (I've resorted to scanning longer documents into multiple 35-page files in knfbReader, a rather untidy but functional workaround.) The app also lacks bookmarking, an essential feature for multi-page documents, especially for the visually impaired. I have resorted to exporting the text as a txt file and importing it into the Voice Dream app, which has superior text-to-voice and ereader capabilities than knfbReader (e.g. use a slider to move forward and back through the text, higher quality voices, automatic bookmarking saves where you left off, syncs with Pocket, displays the amount of time it would take to listen to a selection next to the name, etc.)

Note: I've noticed that the device you use to scan can make a significant difference in scan speed. Changing from an iPod touch 5th gen to an iPhone 6 doubled my scan speed, in part due to faster focusing. When possible, scanning two facing pages of a book at a time doubled my scanning speed again. Tip: Use as bright a light as possible to speed up focus time and, therefore, scan time's under lower light conditions focusing can take considerably longer.

A couple other requests include: 
- Cloud syncing between devices without requiring manually exporting from one device and importing into the app on another device
- More polished user interface

I am sighted and use this app to increase the number of articles and books I can go through by listening instead of reading. I tend to listen to more audiobooks than I read paper books, and my hope is to make more paper articles and books readily accessible in audio form. This app is a great example of how improving accessibility for some can improve it for all. 

In short, knfbReader is a diamond in the rough. At this price, I expect better quality. Once the crashing and bookmarking have been worked out, it could be magnificent. (Then, I would give it 5 stars.) The developers are actively working on it, so with continued effort they may yet refine knfbReader into a solid app worthy of the price.",2017-12-26 08:44:45
OneStep Reader,"In a recent update the speach rate settings are bad.  First of all the range of speach rate is unnessessary.  From way too slow to way too fast.  Secondly, when set on 48 is normal (for me), but slide it to 52 and it's way too fast.  ????  Lastly, when I'm finally able to get the speach rate set it goes back to the default setting every time I close the program.  The default setting is insanely slow.  This whole ""Speach Rate"" issue is very frustrating and needs to be addressed.  Otherwise the app works well.

OneStep Reader,"OK, simply put, if your visually impaired in anyway that you were not able to read text normally, I highly recommend this app, in fact, this app is far more superior to my Parul camera that I have on my computer. That being said, there are two issues, either that or huge but would be nice if they got fixed.

1. Batchmode - this mode allows you to take photos of multiple pages before the app processes the images into text to read to you. The problem is that this mode has a tendency to crash randomly, making the user have to routinely save the batch every 15–20 pages.

2. Photos - for whatever reason, this app holds onto the photos of the pages. This makes sense for legally blind users who want to see any photos that were on the page, but for the 95% of the rest of the time it makes this app a major memory hog if you use it a lot or if you use it to say scan a text book for school. I would really recommend the developers to give the option to delete the photos to help conserve memory on smart phones as well as when it backs up to the cloud.

Side from those two things, yes the price is very steep but it is so worth it if you prefer to just have all of your visually impaired and blind tools on one device rather than walking around like Batman with the utility belt.",2016-02-03 11:14:09

OneStep Reader,"I personally love the KNFB app. It has worked remarkably well and has been a real life changing app. The ""but"" is there because lately it has been more unusable than usable. The KNFB app really started going downhill just before the iOS 9 update and got worse on the iPhone 6s. At that time, we had to wait forever to get an update just to make the KNFB app usable. I say forever, ""but"" it was really only about a month; ""but"" for as much as I use the app that felt like forever. The app worked good after the update at first, ""but"" now the speech rate is all kinds of crazy and it will not save my settings. The most annoying problem though is that the app constantly crashes. If I scan multiple pages the app will get about halfway through the conversion and then crash. Making me start all over again; causing me to waste an enormous amount of time! Now, again, I have been waiting 2 weeks for an update to correct the issues. This is very frustrating because of the amount I use the KNFB app. Also, (this might just be me) ""but"" I believe if I pay $100 for an app I shouldn't have to work through constant crashes, messed up speed rates, and reset my settings every time I open the app. I understand it takes time to go through the process; so maybe I'm just too inpatient.

OneStep Reader,"Very fast! The first thing that impressed me was how quickly as well as accurately this app converts documents and starts reading them to me. This is an amazing game changer, and worth every penny.

I was put off by the price at first, but what this does is really incredible. I highly recommend it and I am very impressed.",2015-01-31 05:49:14

OneStep Reader,"when this application was released, I decided to wait and see what others thought.since it is more expensive than most apps, I wanted to make sure it would work well. it was money well spent. even with the first picture, my results were amazing. so far, I have used it to read mail, a pizza box, and a CD case..if you are wondering whether the application really works well, I can honestly say it does. It's well worth it, it will meet or exceed your expectations.",2015-01-01 16:49:50
OneStep Reader,"This is one of the best reading apps out there.  I've seen it work well for many of my blind/visually impaired friends.  However, it's a bit tricky to use if you have truble with your hands shaking or moving.   I hope that in future updates, this could be worked on.  
I've personally had a hard time getting all four edges of the document to line up with the camra.   Using the field view report thing is also a bit tricky, like someone else pointed out. 
I do like the fact that it allows those with reading disibilities to gain independence as far as being able to read documents and other printed items.
I also hope in future updates, we could be able to use the ALEX voice to read our documents (For those who have ALEX on their devices).  I'm not a huge fan of Samantha, personally.",2014-12-26 13:32:53

It's the best $99 I've ever spent. sure, I had to budget a little bit. But that is quite alright considering that I can take it on the go and read things that I never could before.

OneStep Reader,I have tried tons of OCR apps in the past and they have all flopped. Total fail. Will this app is so much different. It tells you what it sees and doesn't see and the tilt feature is really cool also. It is spot on with its OCR. I'd say about 99% correct. Don't let the price tag scare you. I promise you'll find lots of ways to use this app. It actually just about to save my life when I was able to read a medicine label I would not have followed proper direction since the pharmacist never told me… Just do it you will not regret it.,2014-10-15 12:55:04

OneStep Reader,"I was very excited to try this new app, but am very disappointed. There are a number of problems for a person with low vision:

1)	the icons are not intuitive, and there is no simple legend in the complete manual to show what function each icon performs.
2)	the printed version on the phone is almost, but not quite, large enough for me to read. My vision is approximately 20/100 and the large font on my iPhone allows me to read e-mails and texts easily. Ironically, this app doesn’t even allow for the same large fonts available in these basic iPhone functions.
3)	The first images I took resulted in a text translation that was imply jibberish. I took a picture of a book page, but the text on the screen, and the read aloud translation made no sense. 

An app like this is sorely needed for people who simply have low vision, but aren’t completely blind. I sincerely hope that there will be improvements for those of us who can almost function, but not quite, without adaptive technology.",2014-10-01 12:12:02
OneStep Reader,"This is, by far, the best OCR app. When I can get it to work, the results are excellent.

Unfortunately, getting it to work is a bit of a challenge. First, the field of view report does not give consistent information. I’ve run the report multiple times in the same position and get different results each time. Additionally, sometimes the field report fails to give voice feedback, and you have to dismiss the app and relaunch.

When performing OCR, you often only get portions of the text; this even occurs when the field report indicates that alignment is perfect. Just as in the field report, OCR often fails to provide voice output.

These flaws are a shame, since the app works well when it *does* work.",2014-09-26 18:14:21
OneStep Reader,"Having used two previous incarnations of the KNFB Reader (original and cell phone), I am delighted that KNFB has been able to bring their quality to the iPhone so quickly.  This new version is extremely fast, and the field of view report and conversion feel immediate.

Wow, how great.",2014-09-26 07:27:45

OneStep Reader,What an incredible app it works so great you can read this is a changer for blind people but actually nothing is changed for blind people it's outrageously overpriced so that's meant to be purchased by folk rehab and other government agencies so that blind people have to get permission or they either need to be independently wealthy before they purchase it this price is unconscionable but hey they're making money are they,2014-09-24 12:41:51
OneStep Reader,"This is the app I have been waiting for for the past five years. And it has not disappointed. I have used the previous K NFB reader mobile device and this app for iPhone is much easier to use. It is intuitive. It takes pictures and reads the print   from round spice bottles, small round medicine files, on the back of plastic pouches, in glass picture frames, off of my laptop computer screen. I have many scanner apps on my iPhone and none of them are accurate. But this one is accurate, at least 98% of the time.  Love it. Love it. Love it.",2014-09-20 20:10:34

OneStep Reader,"I have performed several scans that included different types of materials and conditions. I will tell you that no other app I have used even comes close to producing the results of the knfbReader app. I have used Prizmo, which is the only other app that comes close. Yes, the knfbReader app was designed with the visually impaired or blind person in mind and that despite what some will say is its strength. I do not believe this app costs $99.99 just to overcharge a certain segment of the population, the “blind tax,” but instead is a high-quality app that delivers on the features and performance promised. I could say quite a lot, but it really comes down to one thing and that is for you to decide if you want to work hard or work smart. Yes, you can pay less for apps that will do the job, but these other apps require a lot more fiddling to find the best position for extracting enough legible text to figure out what you got. People have used stands of all types to get the job done. With the knfbReader app you do not really need any stands etc. If you have one it will certainly help and especially when doing batches of image captures using the automatic mode. Otherwise, you can simply hold your device about eight to 10 inches above the material and nearly instantaneously get your results. I have absolutely no regrets paying $99.99 for an app that meets a need and I can remove all other apps. BTW, when I figure the cost of apps and a couple of stands I have purchased in trying to find a good solution I probably spent more than the cost of the knfbReader app. :)",2014-09-19 19:17:05

The great advantage is that I can dip in and out of books and skim read like other students, without having to scan entire chapters as PDFs first. You can even use it in the library with a pair of headphones. Stunning.

TapTapSee,"I used to love this app, but it seems like ever since the app became free to use the quality has dramatically dropped. When I first got this app, I would hold it up in front of the LCD display screens on the thermostats in our home to set the temperature. Our thermostats were pushbutton to adjust the temperature, and had switches to change the mode or turn the fan on and off. If I knew what’s the setting was on, I would know how many times to press the button to set it to the desired temperature. For instance, Tap Tap See would tell me that the thermostat was set at 60°, and that the house temperature was 65. I was then able to realize that if I wanted to set the heat at 68 that I would simply need to push the up button eight times. Recently though, I have resorted to calling AIRA when I need help adjusting the thermostat as this app will say something along the lines of thermostat is set at 20/5. Also, I loved the new video feature that was being introduced, with this app, but this feature was very short-lived. I have anxiously been waiting for it to return for nearly a year now, and nothing has come out. Unless a miracle occurs, I suspect this app is finished with updates and will soon be retired just as the Look Tell money reading app was.",2020-02-13 15:32:28
TapTapSee,How do I use this?,2020-02-01 12:20:00
TapTapSee,"This app is great when it comes to acurate discription of objects and seens and such. It's really cool to point it out the window when I'm in a car or something and it tells me pretty accurately what's out there. Like ""Brown field with green trees"" or ""Black car parked in front of store"". It also is really good with discribing objects. I was in a dentist office and they had decorations all around of wrapped presents. I tryed to get seeing AI to tell me about the boxes but it kept focusing on other things like the chair or the table. But tap tap see said ""Red and white striped box"" which is exactly the information I wanted. I usually use Seeing AI for money and stuff because it's quick, but I use this one for objects because Seeing AI not very good. But, one time, I opened the app and it said something like ""Tap the right side of the screen for pictures and left side for video"". I was interested, and tryed it. But it just took another picture. I tryed it in landscape, but same thing. I even looked it up on the website and it said it could do 10 seconds of video, so I tryed again. Still, just a picture. I tryed doing a video with the Galory and I tryed that. Only pictures showed up. The video thing really got my hopes up but it doesn't work. Maybe something happened because it's not in the app discription. If it wasn't for this, it would be a 5 stars most definitly. But because of this it gets the rating it did. I really think if your going to make something for a visually impaired person, make some better directions or if it's not doing it anymore take those direction of the website. Again, I'm really sorry for this, but I think you shouldn't do that.",2019-12-30 12:54:37

Three other apps actually work better a barcode scanner like the one built into the Walmart app another app called seeing AI and a third one called Be My Eyes.

TapTapSee,"What is going on sometimes I can use this app and it works just fine other times I put things in front of it, and it tells me something out rages, and this is horrible, I appreciate they are trying to make an app to help the blind, but some of the results seems like they are trying to trick the blind",2019-02-23 13:02:07
TapTapSee,I love this application. I use it daily. It works great. It rarely fails me. Thank you!,2019-02-10 12:50:29
TapTapSee,"The app does take pictures. However, instead of taking a picture of what’s in front of you, it takes pictures of items that are nowhere near where you are. For example, when I try to take a picture of a CD case it takes pictures of other things in my room.",2019-02-10 05:17:03
TapTapSee,"I used to love this app and have rated it five stars before. However, I am no longer able to do that because the information you now get is not very accurate or specific. Not sure what happened, but I have reached out twice and have not gotten a response. Please address this. As I said in one of my emails to them, I would not mind paying per scan if it meant we could get the level of detail and accuracy we used to get.",2019-02-07 03:38:09
TapTapSee,"I don’t know why, but about a month ago, the identification of objects became much less accurate. And the information provided, even when correct, was less useful. Prior to this last month, I would have given the app 4 stars. Hopefully, it will return to the way it use to be.",2019-02-04 21:28:50
TapTapSee,"This app is completely garbage needs to be updated! Gives non-descriptive answers to photos, if I take a picture of my toothpaste dispenser I don't need to know it's a white tube obviously I'm looking for the name do not download this app no help",2019-02-04 17:23:33
TapTapSee,I have noticed lately that the program is not doing a very good job at all of identifying items like it used to.,2019-02-02 04:21:11
TapTapSee,This version is horrible! I took a picture of my MacBook error and it told me it was a black Samsung TV.,2019-01-31 19:18:27
TapTapSee,"Used to be fabulous… But lately it is claiming random things that I’m showing them. And showing a box of crackers, it says it’s a Gucci bag. In showing a package of seasoning, they say it’s Huggies diapers. What’s wrong guys?",2019-01-29 09:28:46
TapTapSee,"I guess I was one of the first to use this app and I remember having to pay for a certain amount of pictures in the past. However, now I seem to have an unlimited access to the app. I wouldn’t mind paying for it I am grateful for all of you guys that have made such a big impact in our life with the new iOS apps thank you",2019-01-27 23:45:07
TapTapSee,"App used to work great. You could take a picture of just about anything(shirt, pair shoes, dresser, etc.), The app would be quick and accurate about getting back to you with what you were looking at. Regularly, I would use TapTapSee to sort through my paper money, never had any problems. About 2 to 3 weeks ago, I went to use the app for the purpose of sorting through my cash, and something had changed. Now instead of taking a picture of paper currency, and being told that I have either a one dollar bill, or say a $20 bill, I am told that I am looking at a grey and white stamp, or A piece of textile, or maybe even a pink wallet, even though there may be nothing of the sort in the picture.

I used to be able to depend on this app. Now I’ve come to depend on my phones magnifier, Which is much more time-consuming, plus the fact that I do not like to depend on what I’m looking at.",2019-01-26 02:45:40
TapTapSee,I thought win I firstused tap tap Ci I was going to get something else but now I know it’s not what I thought it was just for I am a blind freshman myself and I appreciate your work,2019-01-20 06:06:59
TapTapSee,"This app is extremely useful. I am not completely blind, but I have almost no usable vision that would help me identify colors, read print, etc. This app has helped me out a lot. I can tell what color something is, and it is very good at reading short segments of text. Thank you to the devs for making such an incredible application!",2019-01-19 14:30:42
TapTapSee,"This app used to be very helpful, like if I wanted to know what kind of juice we had, I would just pull out my phone and take a picture of the jug with TapTapSee and it would tell me the flavor and brand. Recently though, it’s gotten really bad. For instance; this morning I was making a bagel and cream cheese for breakfast. I knew what kind of bagels we had, but forgot what flavor cream cheese there was. So I pulled my phone out and go to take a picture of it with TapTapSee. It just told me that it was a white and blue container. So I thought “maybe it’s upside down, I’ll turn it”. Same thing happened again. It’s been doing this for a couple of weeks now, and I would like if this bug could please be fixed. I will change my review to the five stars it deserves once it gets fixed, but as of right now it is only worth one star",2019-01-17 07:38:04
TapTapSee,In the past I got fairly accurate results reading temperatures on my thermostat and also my weight on a scale. I was recently informed that it gave really really bad results for another person using it for temperatures on a thermostat so I tried it myself. It told me that my thermostat was a PS3 with a controller and then it told me my thermostat was an area rug.These were the same types of descriptions given to the other person using it to read temperatures.,2019-01-15 19:13:24

TapTapSee,I love this app. I am blind and helps me tremendously and I would recommend it for all blind people.,2018-10-12 14:36:43
TapTapSee,Thank you so much to whoever created this app. It’s hard to get things in every day life to help somebody did newly became blind and has no money. You lose your job. And everybody wants to charge you for something that doesn’t work. This works great for me.,2018-10-10 05:28:24
TapTapSee,Very helpful! Great app!,2018-10-09 06:19:54
TapTapSee,"Not much to say about this app.
  it's simply   very amazing...

Please keep the updates coming...
 I know  you probably got what you needed from it,
 but  we want this app to be better for everyone

TapTapSee,"Tap tap see is excellent! 99% recognition! Excellent for determining what is in cans, boxes and frozen food bags! It is truly the blind man's emancipation proclamation! An invaluable tool indeed! If you haven't downloaded it what are you waiting for!

TapTapSee,It helps me with so many things from knowing which medicine is which to helping me with food and mail. It helps with so many thing and gives me a idea of what I’m looking at from what it is to what color it is. Best thing is it’s free a lot of apps and things I’ve payed lots of money for don’t help me as much as this app. Thank you to the creators of this app and I highly recommend to anyone with low vision or blind people,2018-06-01 08:56:54
TapTapSee,"I used this app in 4 years ago. I’m so happy with this app because it’s free for taking photos. I was taking photos a lot. Because I couldn’t see my money, checks, uno cards game, math problems for class, movie box, and more. I tried to use app to pictures for we can read it. This is a really good help to read the photos a lot. I remember the TapTapSee if not free for taking pictures. I don’t need to buy more pictures after finishing pictures. So now they have a new update for I can make a free for photos a lot. Better for me. Make sure you can leave it there every time. Thanks very much for using free photos! And you’re  a great working hard a lot 👍",2018-05-27 19:56:32
TapTapSee,Have been using this app for quite sometime I mostly use this app to find a color and every time I have to take several pictures of the item because it will keep saying it’s close which I already know that the item is close I want to know the color and sometimes when it reads the color the actual color is way off from what it really is,2018-05-19 15:16:27
TapTapSee,I really love tap tap see. It helps me stay independent. I don't have to wait till my sister or someone else comes by to read labels when I get things in the mail. I can read my Cincy bars and other wax melts labels to distinguish so I can put bro labels on them. And when I get medicine in the mail I can also read it,2018-05-12 15:31:36

TapTapSee,"My girlfriend told me about this app a couple days ago when I was getting ready to post some pictures of us on my Facebook page, but wasn't sure how many of the recent ones had already been shared. I'm generally very good at this, as I remember The order in which my pictures are displayed very well. She not only told me about the app, but also taught me how to use it after I downloaded it to my phone. Wow! I don't know of a better app out there for this kind of thing. Maybe Facebook should incorporate some of this apps technology/software into how it describes pictures.

The only thing that would make this app even better than it is would be if it described videos. Hopefully, the developers will get on that for a future update!",2017-12-04 13:44:08

TapTapSee,"I think this is a pretty good app for a blind user to have to use for a lot of identification. I've used this app when it first came out or at least since I first heard about it back in 2012 on my iPhone 4s, I was much impressed at to what I heard and now I feel the app has much improved. In fact, the other day, I laid some hand towels out on my bathroom vanity and had the lights on, I needed to know the colors to sort them, since I already knew the colors of towels I had, but not knowing which one was which, I took several pictures with tap tap see and each item was correctly described  of it's color, I managed to even get a pic of myself  of my shirt I was wearing at the time, tap tap see woman wearing a white shirt,that was right too. I've used it in recognizing some items in my pantry as well. It's a good useful app for me, I am very glad it's still available, I had purchased the 100 picture pack, of course I am very glad to have the pictures free, but it would be worth it to me to pay again if that was necessary.",2017-05-19 20:20:49

TapTapSee,"My friend told me about this app recently. She downloaded it to my phone and showed me how to use it. I asked her what it was and she said it was like a camera that tells you what you just took a picture of. It's amazing. I really like the app. Sometimes, when I'm on my tablet and when I don't know what the picture shows, I take a picture of that and tap tap see gives me a pretty good description.

I so look forward to applying this app in many aspects of my daily life. Thank you so very much once again!",2017-03-24 11:37:56
TapTapSee,"I use this in the kitchen to distinguish between similar packages and cans.  It will not read the ingredients or directions, but does basic OCR of larger print.  With clothing, I use it to identify T-shirt or sock prints.  I also use it for taking pictures, the focus tone assisting my position, and the description confirming whether or not I captured my subject reasonably well.  I am so grateful for it being free now!",2017-03-15 16:12:55
TapTapSee,I love this app for several reasons. Number one it opens up a lot to the blind individual. There's a lot of world out there and a lot of it is limited because I can't see.

When I take pictures to post on Instagram, I use TapTapSee to make sure I captured what I wanted to. I do the same thing when someone goofs up and sends me a picture. I've also used it to identify drinks, medicines and my clothes. It's also fun to take random pictures of objects in my house and see what it comes up with. Keep up the good work!!!",2016-05-29 04:56:44
TapTapSee,I'm truly blown away with how well this works. It is able to distinguish things that I didn't think it would have a chance with.,2016-05-23 11:47:40

TapTapSee,"I know I lived for over 60 years without this app, but I can't think how I did it! I can't begin to count how many mystery packages I've revealed with it! I'm about to do one now, from my freezer! I need to get on with it, but had to write and say thank you! Just brilliant!",2016-05-19 06:53:19

TapTapSee,"I can't believe the accuracy of this app. No way AI has gone so far to recognize things I haven't seen myself in my life...

I think there are human operators behind this app!",2016-05-11 05:12:56
TapTapSee,This is a really awesome app! Kudos to the developers to design something so useful for so many people!,2016-05-10 18:29:02
TapTapSee,A really great app!I use it for most anything I need to identify.works very well.,2016-05-02 03:25:24
TapTapSee,I like the app. My only complaint is that when I looked at pictures on my phone itgot those The description wrong. The first picture was of me a blind woman holding my son and TapTapSee said it   was a woman holding a girl. My son is a boy! The second picture was of me a blind woman sitting next to my son and it said man in white hoodie next to kid.,2016-04-30 03:24:10
TapTapSee,"I love this app! You guys are doing a terrific job! Keep up the good work with your photo descriptions!! It was well worth the money when it was a subscription, but I'm tickled that it is now free!",2016-04-26 08:42:17

TapTapSee,Can identify. Pretty much anything. Very accurate and easy to use,2016-04-18 13:21:22
TapTapSee,"this app continues to amaze me. Don't let the legacy hackerware UI fool you. It's what's under the hood that's bringing information to you that is otherwise not available to you tactually. I'm sort of giving it away, but ... Tap Tap See connected with a series of wearables such as the following would be amazing: spectacles, voice assistant/dictation, gloves, belt, high-latency refreshable braille tiles, low profile bone-conduction.     I'm facetiously scoring Tap Tap See a rating of 4 only because I haven't yet found a way to verify that my clothes match. -) It really deserves an 11.",2016-04-17 22:44:54
TapTapSee,This is one cool app for someone that's blind,2016-04-12 21:10:23
TapTapSee,"Seriously! This thing’s ability to recognize objects is strange. It seems to be some mix between OCR and object recognition. I took the same photo from my library and put it into both google’s photo ID software (it gave back just “cat”) and into this and it identified the color and the HAIR LENGTH of my cat. Like… what!? 

Completely blown away by this thing’s power. All it needs is a better UI to go with it, but to be honest I don’t think that matters considering it’s meant for blind people, so a “fancy” UI will only make VoiceOver worse.",2016-04-11 20:17:38
TapTapSee,"This app is wonderful. The only thing is, the current version does not have a front camera op son but I have been told that they are working on it. I love the app and would highly recommend it to others.",2016-04-09 09:13:57

TapTapSee,"Perfect, well, sometimes it says that my cat is a dog, but other than that it has been pretty accurate lolh",2016-03-06 17:51:07
TapTapSee,"Not only does it do a good job of identifying things when you take a picture, I accidentally discovered that it will lookup a barcode if you hold it in front of the camera. It does the lookup in real time, no snapping a picture.   This is an awesome app. The developer should include a donate with PayPal button. I would support this functionality.",2016-03-03 05:33:34
TapTapSee,This app is awesome sometimes it is so detailed it's like I can see I love it helps me get dressed in the morning and helps me recognize all kinds of canned goods and foods and tons of other items it's amazing even recognized and obscure product that my friend sold me from and on on line nature supply,2016-02-29 11:29:58
TapTapSee,"👍👏Well done developers of this app. Probably the best thing that a blind person could get for a birthday gift. However, please remember that posture and facial expression is very important.",2016-02-23 06:44:23
TapTapSee,I like this app because it doesn't just give you the color; it also gives style or namebrand.,2016-02-23 02:44:46
TapTapSee,"Not much to say about this app. You tap a button, the app tells you what you captured with the camera. Also works for photo library. Can't believe this app is free!!!",2016-02-22 20:53:36
TapTapSee,"Now that the app is free for unlimited use, I don't have to worry about being frugal with what I identify! Now I can get more out of the app without spending money. Thanks!",2016-02-18 08:55:31

TapTapSee,Fast and accurate,2016-01-28 15:15:20
TapTapSee,"This app works incredibly well. It is amazing how many items  it can identify almost instantaneously even on older hardware. I believe I find the most use with this app at identifying cans of food which are almost impossible to identify with other  more expensive software such as knfb reader. I find that this app alongside  moneyreader and knfb  reader provide  of the identification and reading that I need to function completely independently. So why is this app yummy? Because without it I wouldn't know which can of soup I was opening.🍴🍜 I wholeheartedly recommend this application alongside cayenne FB reader and money reader as three absolute must have applications. If I could change anything about the app, would add a history that you could review after you reopen the app of the last four pictures. Notification of when the lens is covered or otherwise unable to get a picture before the picture is sent for processing. This would save time for the user and same time for those who must've been the find the pictures. Thanks for a great app!",2015-11-02 19:26:46
TapTapSee,"I love this app. It really is amazing! It can help me by distinguishing colors of socks, shirts, or pants, it can read dollar bills, it can tell what an item is without having to look at a barcode scanner, and it can read text on paper. This is everything I need, bundled in one package. Thank you for this wonderful app. The only problem is that it costs money for taking pictures and for me this is a really big setback but other than that this app is great",2015-10-24 07:27:06
TapTapSee,"It is an amazing app that has helped me a lot. I am glad to know that there are people out there that think of us and make apps that are this accessible. It is a great app that will continue to help me. I recommend this app to any blind or visually impaired person who needs a set of eyes. However, the only thing I say or I think that is a little bit of a challenge is that you have to pay for it all the time.",2015-10-12 09:35:44

TapTapSee,"This app works wonderfully, and has yet failed in getting me roughly 85% accuracy of pictures it processes.",2015-09-26 14:07:48

TapTapSee,This app is very convenient for someone who is totally blind like myself. No need to FaceTime someone and ask them to identify   objects four    me anymore. LOL. Thumbs up from Marquita.,2015-07-28 11:32:53
TapTapSee,"This app is just amazing
It not only identified objects but also their colors and other characteristics",2015-07-25 05:26:32
TapTapSee,"I just got this app and it is very accurate so far. It will tell you what everything is and it will also tail  the color. The only thing I do not like about the app is that it never stated in the description that there was a cost. I only learned there was a cost after reading all for one of the reviews. One of the reviews stated that after 100 photos you have to pay $24.99 for a subscription. So, is this subscription for a year or a certain number of photos? Very misleading if there is a charge.",2015-07-13 18:41:46
TapTapSee,This app is a blind man's dream. I've been waiting for something like this my whole life. Very impressed with how accurately it details whatever photos you take. This app will help anyone with a visual disability or someone totally blind become independent.,2015-07-11 18:03:26
TapTapSee,No  ware in the apps description does it say that you have to pay for a photo subscription after a certain number of pictures!,2015-07-08 20:01:26
TapTapSee,"This app is awesome. I couldn't find one thing that this app scanned wrong. Scans things like ""Right human foot"", ""Black flatscreen computer monitor with gmail open"", or even ""woman with blonde hair and v-neck blue and white t-shirt"". (I took a pic of myself and I was wearing a Giants jersey :3) This app is really amazing! 11/10 stars 🌟",2015-07-01 17:59:12
TapTapSee,"This app is amazing. I had no idea this kind of technology this good even existed! One feature I would like to see is facial description. Si instead of saying it's a face, what if it could describe things like skin color, eye color, hair color, etc.",2015-06-30 13:17:33
TapTapSee,Works as promised. The autofocus beep is very helpful.,2015-06-28 15:38:32
TapTapSee,"This is the first app I show people who are interested in what a blind person can do with an iPhone, and it will be the first I recommend to any new user. It is absolutely a game-changer for us. Need to know the color of your socks? Need to be sure you're posting a picture of your cat to Facebook and not calling your grandma a furry nightmare? Wanna know the license plate number of the car in your driveway? This app does all of that quickly and easily. You do have to pay after the first hundred photos as some kinds of pictures are crowdsourced for answers, but it's entirely worth it. You immediately need far less help day to day and that is priceless.",2015-06-24 00:59:00

TapTapSee,Can't be without it.,2015-05-24 08:34:02

It allows a great deal of independence, and has only become more accurate with its identification as time passes.

I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, especially considering it's price.",2014-07-12 10:28:04

TapTapSee,"I recommend to all blind people to get it. and I selected a photo and it describes it to me. TapTapSee is pretty cool.
It is useful. One day I went to my camera roll TapTapSee has really changed my life.",2014-03-22 22:38:25

TapTapSee,I was born sighted and started to lose my vision a few years ago. (I'm 32.) This app has helped immensely in daily life and has given me independence. Highly recommended!,2014-02-21 12:01:36
TapTapSee,"App can recognize any object, place, part, thing... Just point the camera, take a picture, and it will accurately speak what is in that direction. Since it's specifically built for the blind, it will tell you where the mail came from, what color is a shirt, who is the person in front of you and what they look like and so on. A+++

This is one tool that no blind person should live without!",2014-02-16 07:12:21
TapTapSee,This app is phenomenal! Thank you so much!,2014-02-15 15:57:30
TapTapSee,"Have you ever  wanted an app that would just take a picture and describe what the picture is? Have you ever wanted to know what that thing is that was on the store shelf? Well, with this app, it's possible! I can't tell you how many times I wanted to know what kind of candy is on a shelf at a store, but I just haven't been able to figure it out! With this app, you can. I wish there was seriously a 10 star rating, because I would totally give this app a 10 star rating. I mean come on, they make you pay 4 bucks on up  a month? That's less than they should make you pay for it, for all the things that it does!  People want to complain that you need to  pay for the app? It's stupid! I mean, come on! These wonderful people put so much time into this app, if people want to complain just because they have to subscribe to the app, and they have to pay a lousy $4 or up!  That's nothing! I just love this app so much, that I couldn't bear just pay $10, and have to pay $10 again after the end of the month. So, I did the next best thing! I paid for three months. Because, I get so much use out of this app, I felt like paying for three months, and getting Not only  my moneys worth, but my pictures worth, Since they are unlimited pictures!  TapTapSee, you guys are the best, as far as describing pictures, and making the results come fast! I can't give you guys enough gratitude! I was so amazed, that this app can read labels, read mail, and so much more! I think you guys are doing a wonderful job for The blindness  community, and thank you very much for putting out a wonderful app! Rock on!",2014-02-13 07:59:58
TapTapSee,"I use to love this app. It is a very useful app to the blind, however they are now starting to charge for the use of this app which I cannot afford and do not think it's worth it.",2014-01-29 17:42:41
TapTapSee,Great app very useful. It's a great app finally technologies beginning to catch up with those who need the most. However this app has a very bad for all you have to keep paying for credits! Which was not in a description of the app if that is the case you have to pay for credits in order to use the app it needs to be on the description bar however this is a wonderful yet at an extremely useful. I will continue to buy credits because what else can you do if you need the app. However I think it is wrong to make you pay for something you need. Period.,2014-01-28 15:12:22
TapTapSee,"This is a great app. It can be a great help to many with all levels of visual impairment.  We use it regularly in our disability outreach (moreableinc.org) with great results and consumer feedback. Very well-designed and developed; this app requires little if any training because it is pretty self-intuitive.  The timely, courteous, and professional tech support is second to none -- wish all tech companies could be like these folks!  Amazing app is absolutely correct!",2014-01-24 16:17:52
TapTapSee,Great app until it makes you pay.. Screw it,2014-01-23 20:29:38
TapTapSee,"For the visually impaired this app is not that helpful. This app has potential but having to turn on the Voice Over option makes it really bothersome because then all of the touch commands are different. So I you can see well enough to navigate your iPhone with Voice Over On, then you don't need this app.  But the identification of items is crazy good. So I would say it depends on what you want the app to do for you.  For me, it's not worth the hassle of trying to use the phone with the Voice Over On.  Can you change it to work with just the sound/volume On?",2014-01-23 11:03:12
TapTapSee,"I cannot emphasize enough what an amazing app this is! It works perfectly. I tried it with many different objects, and it recognized all of them. Truly a marvel for blind people. Comes in handy tremendously. However, I am not fond of having to purchase picture packages in order to have continual use of the product. I feel a flat rate would be a much more efficient Way to be charged. I'd pay $5-$10 for this app but don't think I should have a continual charge from month to month or as a pay as you go status. Again, wonderful app… Totally perfect! Hope you decide to make a paid version",2014-01-13 20:47:34
TapTapSee,I would rate 5 stars only problem is that after a certain amount if photos taken you are required to pay to take more photos but other than that it has a great concept and is very useful 😎😊,2014-01-11 13:26:18
TapTapSee,Used it on a few pictures in my photo library and it worked amazingly well! Works well on recognizing animals and people too.,2013-12-03 20:44:37
TapTapSee,"This app works extremely well, all the pictures I took were accurate and gave detailed descriptions! But a $10 paid subscription for a month? I think that this app is a great resource and shouldn't have to be paid for. Very disappointed.",2013-12-01 08:11:24
TapTapSee,"Tap tap see is AWESOME ,smiling tabby cat ,blue jeans money and more! Love this ap  Buy it and enjoy",2013-11-25 20:28:35

TapTapSee,"this used to be one of my favorite and most used apps. as a blind person, this app came in handy for identifying canned ggoods, medications, movies, even sometimes colors of clothing. Now however you have to pay for pictures and I have to say I think this is outrageous. they took a good thing and made it a very bad thing. I won't be recommending this app anymore to my friends. and sadly, I won't be using it anymore. It's too bad because it's hard to find good identifier apps out there. and this  app was really really good.  the blind have to already pay so much for adaptive equipment as it is. This was awesome while it lasted. tap tap see just went bye bye.",2013-11-18 16:27:09
TapTapSee,I tried this app it was very helpful. I'm not blind I just tried this app out it be great for seeing impaired,2013-11-16 23:20:30
TapTapSee,This app works as a good identification of objects for blind people. It also is extremely helpful in that we can take recognizable pictures to show our cited friends without having to think up a verbal description which may or may not be accurate. Good show.,2013-11-15 05:52:33
TapTapSee,"Fabulous! Amazing! So easy. It is literally as easy as open, point, click. After it gives you a few pictures to sample it will tell you to pick a payment plan. Seven dollars for 100 pictures or nine dollars unlimited monthly. I chose unlimited monthly. I will be using this every day all day long.",2013-11-13 17:27:19
TapTapSee,"It used to be a great app and it used to work really well but now you have to pay 9.99 for pictures for one month. I if you happen have the old version keep a hold of it and do not update it. t seems like that's a high price. This app is so good that I took a picture of a tv screen and it told me who was playing, that it was basketball, and that the score was 36 to 55 and the winning team.. Wow. I also regularly use it to snap photos of items that I can't identify. I am totally blind. And I can snap photos from inside of a car and it never fails to tell me what we are driving by. For example, it said at one point today ""photo of a car in parking lot with green trees and a brown grassy field nearby. "" this was taken from a moving car. Another great use of this app is to snap photos of food to make sure it is what you want to open. Snap a photo of each side of a box of food and it will analyze each side of it. Snap photos of people and it tells you what kind of shirt they are using. Amazing.",2013-11-12 19:13:10
TapTapSee,"I am not liking to pay for pictures that I take. $10 a month is outrageous. I don't want to pay for a subscription for this app. If I looks like I will have to find a Nother identifier app that won't charge weird rates like that. did pay $10, it had better be for the app itself. Come on now.",2013-11-07 07:28:16
TapTapSee,"Went around the office to identify a lot of things and even some items that appear on screen, e.g. Image attachment.  I am so impressed with this product, I'll be sure to show it to all the other Voice Over users in my circle.

Thank you so much!",2013-10-23 11:42:09
TapTapSee,I got this for my blind father. He is still learning to use it but even I have fun trying to stump the app! I hope in the future the app will improve and advance so it could read everything and that the camera was more like the one on the money reader app. He can't tell if the pic is in focus when he takes it.,2013-10-22 16:34:03
TapTapSee,"Perhaps one of the most innovative apps to come along in the history of iOS devices. For a blind person, it's very fabulous to use it to identify things in your house as well as read labels on food cans, and other stuff. 
I love it.",2013-10-18 19:25:31
TapTapSee,I use this app on a daily basis. It has help me do everything from making sure my son's clothes match to making sure that I'm preparing the right foods. It is wonderful and I really thank the people who've made it available to the blind community.,2013-10-18 18:43:51
TapTapSee,This app is helpful and accurate when the picture of an object is taken Correctly. But sometimes I have to take the picture more than once in order to get the desired description. That is sometimes not convenient.,2013-10-13 19:13:36

TapTapSee,"I use this app all of the time! It's good for identifying money, and reading labels  of food and stuff. Once you figure out how to take pretty accurate pictures, it's very good at describing them. I found that it even describes pictures that you have in your photo album very well too.",2013-09-05 16:28:00
TapTapSee,"Not only does it detect colors   but also labels, that is you can hold something up to it and it will say for example  ""Bottle of Sobe  Lifewater Black & Blue Berry""  or ""Febreeze Pet order eliminator"". Even works with the screen curtain on!  It's simply brillant!",2013-09-04 16:19:58

I no longer have to worry about placing them in an exact position so that I can find them later. It's so simple for me to discover the brand name of the food that I'm buying, which allows me to log everything that I'm eating more accurately. I can identify money. I can take pictures of my cat and share them on Facebook. I can take pictures out my window to try to see what my cat is looking at out there.

Though I can't always know what the picture is because of the description, it is still helpful to know what they are  even in  a general way. I  also  took pictures of some remodeling  that was done in my kitchen, and they turned out well. I did ask someone before sending, just wanted to make sure.  i also took a few shots for Facebook of my animals. One time, I just got the description white fur.  which was one of my cats.

TapTapSee,"I have never written a review before, but I have a strong urge to enhance this app for my Deafblind community, including myself. I do love the simplicity of its design and its grayish icon of an eye. I strongly suggest that it should have an accessible version for Deafblind (DB)— they would appreciate reading descriptions and converted text so that they won't feel inhibited in their access to visual information around them. Another suggestion is I don't know what limitations an iPhone 5 has, but it would be incredible to know the sound information around them, such as the ""inaudible"", ""music playing"", ""chatting"" and so on. Siri is able to recognize sounds and therefore, it should have a technology to detect sounds. In addition, it should include three different modes: Braille/Sizable text, Sound, and both that they can switch seamlessly. I will restore my 5 star rating when it's accessible for DB.  :'(",2013-05-21 20:45:54
TapTapSee,Hi!!! This app is amazing!! I am deaf blind myself and would like to see a possible app that's accessible for deaf blind! But keep it up!!,2013-05-21 15:38:31
TapTapSee,it even works when you don't show a label or part of the label -  it also identified my dog is well :-),2013-05-19 09:14:35
TapTapSee,"The usefulness of this app keeps growing. It has helped me set the washing machine dial, informed me of food & drink items, and my favorite... I just pointed it to the TV screen and with a few picture snaps, I knew the song & artist information displayed. More than cool!!!  A+",2013-05-15 10:07:40
TapTapSee,I have found several uses for TapTapSee. First it is spot on reconizing things around me.  Second it is able to read print on boxes and containers.  Third is probably my favorite one it acts as a color reader and it more accurent than many APPs that I paid for.  Keep up the good work. Wonderful APP.,2013-05-13 16:38:00
TapTapSee,"I'm bothered by the message stating my service will be denied if I enter a photo with any nudity/partial nudity etc. I think a blind person should have the same opportunity to know what is around them. Otherwise, this is a phenomenal service.",2013-05-12 16:43:30
TapTapSee,I use this app every day. You will not be disappointed.,2013-05-10 18:43:31
TapTapSee,"In one of life seems very useful for people with visual impairments Thank you for making a great program if this function when the repeat button is pressed, the voice-overs for read only once, can not understand what you mean, but the characters that can identify I hope",2013-05-09 20:50:52
TapTapSee,"Great app and one that I will recommend to my students who are blind or visually impaired whom I teach iPad with accessibility features! To those with the questions on how to make it repeat, single finger flick back until you hear the button ""repeat"" then double tap (one finger for those new to VoiceOver) and it will repeat the description. 
NLB",2013-05-09 18:23:56
TapTapSee,"I agree with those that say that this program is awesome. The only thing is, and it may just be me, I can't figure out how to get voiceover to repeat what it say it after the pictures take. I just take another one if I need it.",2013-05-09 10:19:45
TapTapSee,A must have! Works every time and very accurate.,2013-05-06 06:50:33

TapTapSee,App blocked me for no reason.,2013-04-07 13:25:22
TapTapSee,"If you are a voice over user, this app is great! It's especially good at reading names of bottle & canned foods as well as reading at least the headings of papers on bulletin boards. It also reads the writing on balloons & gift cards, even when there is a lot of graphics and other scanning OCR apps can't read through the graphics.",2013-04-06 19:58:18
TapTapSee,Awesome Very useful and helpful and descriptive,2013-04-05 08:41:16
TapTapSee,"This app is amazing. It identifies just about everything you can imagine. Being blind myself, it has helped me identify things that I would otherwise have to wait for my husband or children to help me with. Not having to depend on sighted help is nice once in a while. I can't wait for the new app these guys are going to put out called CamFind.",2013-04-01 15:33:54
TapTapSee,this app is great! hope to see more updates soon.,2013-03-31 14:25:23
TapTapSee,This app blows me away with how it can identify almost anything. I have yet to fool it. Absolutely amazing. Speechless.,2013-03-30 16:53:35
TapTapSee,"The accuracy of photo recognition is uncanny. At times it seems like there must be a person on the other end identifying things. Wish it was faster (realtime), but that's what the future is for.",2013-03-30 16:25:19
TapTapSee,"I have scanned practically everything in my house. 100% accuracy. This app is truly amazing. My cat apparently is a gray striped cat. That was great. Response times are for the most part quick. The next iteration of this app, called camFind, is due out next week. I eagerly await it. This will be TapTapSee on steroids.",2013-03-30 13:00:45
TapTapSee,One of my closest friends is blind and apps like these are game changers. This app is fast and incredibly accurate.,2013-03-30 12:57:04
TapTapSee,"I love this app! I am now able to know what is in cans, medicine bottles, and other product containers in my home. I can also now know the colors of my shirts and pants and other items. I plan to use this app a lot. You do have to often take 3 to 4 pictures. If you take enough pictures, you can get more detail. But perhaps this is user trial and error. We will see if more  practice brings more accuracy. I admit I am new at this. It is an incredible app.",2013-03-30 09:25:20
TapTapSee,Thank you so much for your altruistic devotion. It's not only fascinating but accurate app.,2013-03-26 17:37:55
TapTapSee,This takes a little getting used to and lighting is very importyant to get good results but once you get used to it it's great.,2013-03-26 14:32:26
TapTapSee,I found the recognition in this app to be very good. It's lots of fun to snap a picture and hear what I am taking a picture of.,2013-03-23 09:04:01
TapTapSee,The  app is great but i wish u could save the pics u take so u can always have them.,2013-03-23 07:33:41
TapTapSee,This app is amazing. This can identify way more than I expected it to. Wouldn't be surprised if Apple ends up buying this.  This looks like it could become apart of iOS.  Could be the next siri!,2013-03-20 19:38:41
TapTapSee,"I took pictures of pretty much everything I could find when I first got this app, and it identified everything. When the novelty wore off, I focused only on food. I'm good at identifying some food items by touch but some items are hard to identify on my own. For instance, I might know I'm picking up a TV dinner, but which one? All my soup bottles feel the same as well. I have frozen veggies and meats in my freezer. With this app, I don't have to get my hands cold feeling inside the bag to see what it is I have in my hand. I only need to reach inside the bag now once I'm sure of what the item is. No longer do I need to wonder if I'm actually opening my can of tomato sauce instead of beans. What's great about this app is that you can submit up to five pictures at once. So if you're not sure where the front of the box is vs. the back, you can take pictures of both sides.  Or you can take  a picture of a can from different angles if you're not sure where the name of the item is on the can. This makes the app very effective. I'm very pleased with this app.",2013-03-18 16:47:18
TapTapSee,Is a very awesome app thanks for the work they fled to be free,2013-03-18 06:03:06
TapTapSee,This app is cool,2013-03-16 08:07:01
TapTapSee,Very wonderful and I would love to be able to save pictures with descriptions. I could post to fb or send in other ways. An additional dream for the future but this app is more then I could have ever hoped just a short few years ago. Thanks for the new freedom.,2013-03-13 19:57:17
TapTapSee,This app increases the independence of those who are blind and visually impaired because it decreases the dependence on their side it appears to obtain information and identification of objects in the use of this app keep up the good work it's awesome and wonderful thank you,2013-03-09 17:38:54
TapTapSee,"I can't say enough about this app. It is so beneficial to the blind community. It works great, it's even better than when I first downloaded it. Keep up the good work. Don't change anything on it unless you increase the wonderful qualities it already has. What a good job you've done",2013-03-09 17:26:10
TapTapSee,Excellent app!! Very useful!! Keep up the good work guys!,2013-03-08 14:20:47
TapTapSee,"Thank you for this app.
Being blind this app is a life saver!
Keep up the great work!",2013-03-05 13:47:34
TapTapSee,"I never thought that an app like this would be possible! IQs this app on a daily basis to do everything from identifying my clothing to actually thinking out entrances of restaurants! This is an app that I would easily pay $10-$20 for! Keep up the excellent work! Also, I am doing my part to get the word of this application out! One thing that would be nice however is way to minimize the delay between imagesetting and recognition what I mean is from the time that a picture is taken to the time when the image is processed that being said, this app has changed the way I do everything in my daily life! Please keep up the support on this app and keep the accuracy coming I have already communicated this app and five other people now have it because of me",2013-02-27 00:45:33
TapTapSee,This app works wonderfully. I have used it for so many things and it almost always identifies whatever I take a picture of. It is so useful! Thank you developers!,2013-02-24 06:34:04
TapTapSee,"Terrific app. I can now tell the can of corn from the can of beans and my red shirt from my blue shirt. Easy to use and surprisingly accurate, although it has trouble identifying some colors. Makes life a lot easier.",2013-02-19 06:28:47
TapTapSee,This is great app for helping the blind identify virtually anything that needs to be identified without asking sighted help,2013-01-30 20:42:43
TapTapSee,"Great app, very useful, and completely accessible with voiceover!",2013-01-28 05:35:52
TapTapSee,This is a revolutionary app for the iPhone for blind and visually impaired. I'm amazed at how fast it is at identifying objects. This will be useful just about anywhere!,2013-01-26 14:10:09
TapTapSee,Thank you for making an app that is so simple. There are other object recognition apps out there but I think this one is the best so far.,2013-01-24 09:08:54
TapTapSee,"For a free app, this one isn't bad. It recognized all that currency bills I presented it, and most of the various products. However, there should be a repeat feature. What if the person did not hear what was read the first time?
Also, under the about heading, there is no apparent text. At least voiceover does not see it. What is the point of having an about heading when there is no text present?
Aside from these things, this app is pretty neat. I hope it continues to be further developed, and it certainly has the potential to be extremely useful for those of us who are visually impaired.",2013-01-17 20:19:02
TapTapSee,"This product was excellent for identifying currency, but I was disappointed that I could not get it to recognize labels on cans of soup. It would only say ""canned good"". As a totally blind person, I found currency easy to position because I could just lay the currency flat and hold the phone directly above it. But to identify anything else, I think this product might work well for people with some vision, but has a long way to go in terms of being user friendly for totally blind consumers.",2013-01-14 21:03:44
TapTapSee,"I really like this app a lot. My only complaint is that the results are only spoken once, and if you miss it, there's no way to go back and repeat or review. It appears that humans may be processing the pictures.",2013-01-14 08:24:42
TapTapSee,"This is a very simple app to use, and it works great also. For being a visually impaired person, this app works very well. I was trying to use this app with numerous items around the house, and it seems to recognize all of them. It even told me that the ball I was holding was red. The only thing, that I thought was funny, was when I pointed the camera at the ceiling, and the results came back as, white carpet.",2013-01-13 15:56:13
TapTapSee,I have been using it for about a month now and it works fine I use it for everything and I never have the house without my phone now it recognized everything like the remote drinking glass and when I pointed it at a sign it tells me what's on the sign I am very happy with it I don't know how it works but the responses are so human that I think it is a person on the other end telling what it is,2013-01-11 18:41:36
TapTapSee,"FINALLY, an app that can seamlessly and ACCURATELY paint a picture of whatever environment you may be in with its instant object recognition.  One of Apple's better apps for anyone with a vision impediment, and so easy to use too!  Also great for surveying, and if you're like me, great for remembering directions :) Thank you, thank you!  The App Store needs more sharp yet simple apps like this.  TapTapSee is a great find and an invaluable tool that you can whip out of your pocket whenever you need it.  This is a utility app that I ACTUALLY get great use out of!",2012-11-01 16:44:10
TapTapSee,"I was very skeptical about this app at first only because my aunt was visually impaired, but after downloading and testing it, I was surprised. This app reads money!!!!!Other apps that do that are usually $10!!!And this app is free!i was surprised that when I took a picture of my cat it returned perfect result including my cats breed and color!So far I've been using it for couple of hours and it has not crashed on me, so i'm leaving this app on my phone even though I'm not visually impaired.",2012-11-01 16:11:14
TapTapSee,"Absolutely lov this App!
Such a simple and wonderful App to use. Since downloading this App in 2018, I have loved taking photos with it ever since. The image  descriptions  are really accurate. I particularly recommend this App if you are going through sight loss. 
Overall, it is a fantastic App!",2019-12-29 13:39:00
TapTapSee,"Not as good and as detailed as this used to be. A little bit disappointed in it recently. For an example, if I wanted to take a photograph of a T-shirt with an owl on it, it used to tell me there was an owl and now it just tells me there is a t-shirt  with a pattern or something. It is not really the kind of detail level that I require. Same applies if I am trying to identify something in a tin. It used to tell me what was in the tin or at least give me an idea that I had got the label the wrong way round so I could turn it and then take the photograph again to get the information. Please please bring back more detail!",2019-09-06 01:43:49
TapTapSee,Great very useful app are used it but then I deleted it and I thought when I went into the App Store and I go and I went to apps and then I then I was like swiping up with three fingers and then I found apps with voice-over and then I found a TapTapSee and I re-downloaded it and it’s a great app,2019-04-10 08:06:20

Are used to also use it to read the temperature on my thermostat but as of late the tap tap see you cannot see the digital display any more I wonder why there is this change. Overall it is a very good product,2019-01-24 02:15:43
TapTapSee,A very nifty little app. Use it all the time. Why can't I have it on my iPad as well? Great for taking photos and looking at them.,2019-01-23 03:18:56
TapTapSee,"Oh dear! Taptap see used to be a really good app, but with this latest version, you’ve broken the terms of condition screen.

TapTapSee,I took a picture of a poster and it identifies the people in it. I would definitely requimend this app it is very accurate,2018-05-04 14:52:39
TapTapSee,This  App is very good for describing images of rooms and  environments but  not so much people. Could also benefit with  the description of ethnicity of people in images. Hope this improves,2018-01-21 03:49:25
TapTapSee,"TapTapSee is very much like having my eyesight back. Enabling me to work independently, reviewing photographs and much more as I go. In fact when I first downloaded the app, I opened up my family's wedding album and had a whale of a time… Thank you very much",2017-10-14 08:02:19
TapTapSee,"It called a picture of a raccoon dog a 'raccoon'. Other than that, it can recognise sniper guns, different art styles and weather the lights in a room are on, or if it's just the flash. Convolutional neural networks are the future.",2017-08-30 17:34:33
TapTapSee,"Take a photo, wait for 10-20 seconds and I gives a detailed accurate description of the scene e.g. A brown and black Yorkshire terrier. Copper coins in a mason jar. A MacBook Air.

The grammar describing the scene is poor when using English. The user interface is designed for those with poor vision so don't expect it to look impressive.",2017-05-18 13:05:39

Pity the IDIOT that called it bull rap does not have the brain capacity to understand that it does not have to be all bells and whistles.

TapTapSee,"Brilliant app. Has rescued me on several occasions, I love this app and I recommend it to any VI",2013-03-16 03:23:16
TapTapSee,"I can see how this app would be useful if I was. The accuracy is amazing! My girlfriend was bringing me objects to see if I could identify them, not one mistake.",2013-03-09 00:48:56
TapTapSee,Amazing app. My son is totally blind and we have been using this a lot.,2013-03-06 08:10:48
TapTapSee,"Download this and give it a try, you will be amazed at it accuracy. Had me taking photos of everything just for the hell of it :)",2013-03-02 01:03:22
TapTapSee,"It's easy to see that these comments are made by the developers of the app them selves, this app is worse then the day my dog got ran over by a skate board, I mean seriously..? How dose a dog die from a skate board??!",2013-02-18 18:33:20
TapTapSee,"Thanks to the developers taking the time to update this app I am now able to use it on my iPod touch. Thank you very much; I really appreciate it. I'm not exactly sure what the focusing thing is four because it doesn't seem to do much. But that's okay.I can now, without help, identify objects. This app is really very useful.
Thank you once again!",2013-02-10 03:07:57
TapTapSee,"It works fine now on none flash devices, thanks for update!",2013-02-09 05:50:09
TapTapSee,The app works really well identifying everyday objects with a good level of detail. Slow 3G is an akillies heal but not the developers fault. Mobile Networks just need to step up.,2013-02-09 01:14:58
TapTapSee,This app is brilliant and I don't need to rely on family members to tell me which flavour of food packets are in a certain box. I no longer need someone to find a tin of Baked Beans for me. apps such as this gives me much more independence in the kitchen.,2013-02-01 13:28:57
Seeing Assistant Home,The barcode reader is excellent for taking inventory of certain items and getting an exact SKU number,2022-02-21 08:06:32

Digit-Eyes,"This used to be the best barcode scanning app for blind people, but not anymore. I cannot get any barcodes to scan at all with this app now. Has the developer abandoned this project? If so, I really think this app should be taken out of the App Store, As there are much better alternatives out there now which are continuing to be developed and supported.",2022-04-03 01:14:14
Digit-Eyes,"Apple is supporting this fraud and thief app.
No refund after using it for 5mins which was enough to see that this is nothing more that the Camera’s built in barcode reader.

If you want to pay 10 bucks for nothing this is the perfect app for you!

Shame on Apple and developer that there is no refund / or trial for this prior buying.",2020-04-08 10:50:55
Digit-Eyes,Really works great!! thanks for taking time to develop Digit Eyes.,2019-09-03 06:46:11
Digit-Eyes,"The first thing I will say concerning the Digit-Eyes app is this; if you are a person easily frustrated and/or unwilling to put  effort into challenges, I strongly recommend you avoid this app.

The above comment is not intended to diss digitize it anyway. It’s just that it will take some time and practice to get fairly successful with digitize. I personally find it to be an extremely helpful option because I live alone and I got, frankly, tired of accidentally adding sauerkraut to my chili when I think I’m adding tomatoes. In short, I find digit-eyes an extremely useful and usable app!",2019-05-11 07:24:24
Digit-Eyes,"I don’t often write reviews, but this app was so disappointing, I felt compelled to. In 15 minutes of trying to scan multiple items, even with sighted assistance, I was only able to scan one item using the app. And, that item wasn’t even in the database. Even when the camera was pointed directly at the barcode, the scanner did not pick it up. Please save your money, and buy an overpriced coffee at Starbucks.",2018-05-22 20:38:56
Digit-Eyes,"I also find it very useful to identify spices… I pondered for weeks and had to label my spices and realized that they already have a barcode on them and I just scanned them and know what is what… Totally awesome… if you have trouble printing labels to years… Just spend a couple dollars and buy some from Digit-Eyes… It isn't worth the prostration I am always very hesitant to spend money on apps… I reluctantly bought this airport $10 and as I say… It's worth $10,000 to me… there is a slight learning curve to learn how to find and scan the barcode… But in a day or two… I am old pro… If you have questions… They are there to answer the telephone… That is a big plus there is some prostration with learning to find the barcodes… But be patient… Work with it… And… As I say… It is worth it's weight in gold… another thing that is pretty cool about the app is when it recognizes the barcode you hit the more information link and in many instances it gives you nutritional data for that particular product… also… Some products will give you cooking instructions also no more six or seven open cans in the fridge that were mistakenly identified last week and never use because I open the sauerkraut when I was looking for the kidney beans… LOL",2017-06-17 19:28:26
Digit-Eyes,Customer some more support is terrible! Been trying a month to get technical support to help with the printer time out problem. Both phone call attempts and email attempts failed to get a response. Do not recommend relying on this apps technical support for any assistance. Less than one star.,2017-02-24 12:07:25
Digit-Eyes,"I like this app, but except for one thing. I would also like to have the prices read along with the item. How are you suppose to know what the price if you're blind/visually impaired? Doing a web search will take to much time, and you won't be able to find someone all the time in the store. What do you do then???!",2016-11-11 13:34:29
Digit-Eyes,"This app if you know and have patients how to learn how to focus your camera and look for the barcode is very good. It can be difficult to use but not because of the app, more because of my not knowing where the barcode is.  I appreciate the beeping to let me know that I am close to the barcode.",2016-05-22 05:42:07
Digit-Eyes,"Once the barcode is found, the app will give you the name of the item. It does not search any product databases to give detailed information. I am not sure why it claims to be the best. I have already found three average products it does not recognize. Also, if you are looking for cooking instructions this app will not suffice.",2016-01-24 08:50:49
Digit-Eyes,"While their are several barcode scanners available, this one is the simplest to use without sighted assistence. Right away it recognizes a lot of the things in the average kitchen. Figuring out where exactly the barcode is on items to scan them in the first place is the hardest part but does get easier with practice/experience. The more advanced functions of the app are optional, but it only gets more and more useful the more you dive in. Definetly read the website's tips to get all the use out of it.",2015-06-23 19:10:11
Digit-Eyes,"It helps to turn objects on their side, and scanned from above. It still takes some time for some objects that are larger, but it does work. Certain things are found relatively easily, and it Recognized most of the things that I threw at it. Somethings have directions for use, other things do not. I would say that overall then, this is a quick, or relatively so, way to at least figure out what you're holding.",2013-06-04 11:00:03
Digit-Eyes,"I've had this app for about 2years now, and it's still useful. Hands down this app has helped me so much and is a great tool for finding products in my kitchen.",2013-02-03 05:33:20
Digit-Eyes,"Bought this app for my visually impaired mom. When it works, it works great. But most of the time even with a perfect image of bar code, the app can't see it. Seems to like boxes better than cans. Only worked about 10% of the time. Please note I am not complaining about local brand bar codes needing to be added. If that is all it was this would be a great app. But it just doesn't ""see"" the barcode to begin with. App should been free or at least no more than $3.",2012-08-12 18:52:07
Digit-Eyes,This app works with the built-in device voice over.  There are many free QR code scanners and creators that will do the same thing.  Very disappointing I paid for this. I thought it had something more for the price.  Run - don't walk - from this app.,2012-07-26 16:32:00
Digit-Eyes,"I've been using Digit-Eyes since it first came out.  While it takes a little bit of learning to get good at scanning, once you get the hang of it, it's amazing how useful this app can be.  I use it primarily to identify cans in my pantry.  It's faster than putting labels on incoming stuff.  You get to know where the bar code is, how to old the can, and can have successful scans in a second or three.  The new extended information is great too.  For many things I scan, I can get ingredients and cooking instructions.  The developers are fast, friendly, and really want to help you get the most out of the app.",2012-05-08 16:14:17
Digit-Eyes,"Once I got the technique for how to place and hold the phone, I got wonderful results with this application. Definitely worth the $. It was frustrating to use at first, but it was my scanning technique that was causing my frustration, and not the application. It works well.",2012-05-06 02:14:00
Digit-Eyes,"This is a great app. I am totally blind, and I have been using the app all day since I got it last night. it is important, to go to the website read the instructions, follow the instructions and then try using the app. Note, I'm using 3 G.",2012-05-02 15:35:04
Digit-Eyes,"This app is great for the price! I've only used it to scan UPC codes so far, and this has been very helpful for identifying items like canned goods in my kitchen. It took some playing around to find the best way to get the camera to capture the code, but it gets easier and easier with practice! I'm looking forward to using the other features!",2012-04-25 20:00:45
Digit-Eyes,Just retested with the 4s and was able to identify a soop can. Still found the process frustrating,2011-11-08 21:21:38
Digit-Eyes,"Quite difficult to scan factory bar codes with my 3gs, needs good light and a lot of luck.  Basically a waste of money for me considering how little I use it and how poorly it reads my cans and boxes.",2011-07-28 15:33:07
Digit-Eyes,"I am not only using this app as it is intended, I am showing it off and amazing everyone with it - especially with my refreshable braille device paired to my iPhone 4. In this way, using the text-labels, Digit - Eyes is accessible and practical for deaf-blind individuals also! Great job with this app! I would LOVE to see the next version include the option to pause while recording a label, with a slider to advance it, back it up, or add to an existing recorded label. This way, we could record entire recipes, etc. in a single label. I'm proud of this app!",2011-04-19 16:17:08
Digit-Eyes,Light years ahead of similar apps. I work with the blind and sight impaired and this app will improve lives and improve independence. Thank you!,2010-11-10 23:39:12
Digit-Eyes,"Have used version 1 and 1.0.1 and was waiting for an update before writing a review. I have attempted to use the bar code scanning aspect many, many times and all times, it never works! This is a rip off and certainly not worth  $30! This should not be considered a bar code scanner. There are apps that are free or very low cost, which do a way better job than this worthless app.",2010-09-20 17:50:26
Digit-Eyes,"Simply put, this app is wonderful and I'd highly recommend it! The camera improvements of the iPhone 4 further enhance the app's functionality,making it even faster and easier scanning bar codes and labels alike.

I needed to scan two identically shaped bottles of hair care products and Digit-Eyes made this possible in under five seconds for each bottle with my iPhone 4 and no special lighting conditions. Thanks and kudos to Digital Miracles for making such a great product!!!",2010-07-25 18:57:20
Digit-Eyes,"I was disappointed when I couldn't get it to run on my new iPhone 4, but the new version has fixed that and the app runs great! Very cool concept.",2010-07-01 12:27:39
Digit-Eyes,Just awesome how easy and accurate it was. Great product for VoiceOver users. It makes me feel really good that developers are making apps for VI users,2010-06-24 13:22:16
Digit-Eyes,"Great app, actually does what it says on the box. I find it particularly useful for reading manufacturer's barcodes to identify products that aren't distinctly packaged. Once you get the nack of scanning the barcodes and a feel for where they are generally located on the packaging (see www.digit-eyes), it becomes easier and easier. If you can't see well enough to read, invest some money in this app and some time in learning to use it for worthwhile results.Please note that scanning takes some practise, so when you start off, remember that the app actually works and its just a learning curve.More manufacturerer info when reading barcodes and fixing a bug which causes the app to exit after a second scan would get 5 stars from me.",2010-06-28 22:02:02
Digit-Eyes,"On buying the app found finding UPC codes impossible as blind, and no demo so disappointed",2010-06-25 15:03:58
Cash Reader for the Blind,My go to tool for recognizing cash. Works fantastic no regrets.,2025-02-01 20:45:18

Cash Reader for the Blind,The app is very bad zero stars in the force invaded by the premium version this is Sharon Nunez 562,2023-12-28 00:27:55
Cash Reader for the Blind,This app is useless unless you pay.,2023-06-15 15:45:12
Cash Reader for the Blind,A great app which makes life of people with a vision limitation easy and independent. Many currencies for when you travel. Great job.,2022-10-30 08:32:54
Cash Reader for the Blind,Can’t use Siri,2022-08-12 14:05:21
Cash Reader for the Blind,I scanned a fake one hundred dollar bill and it still said it was real even though the bill has play money printed on it. Don’t waste your time with it.,2022-08-05 18:49:07
Cash Reader for the Blind,"While I was at first reluctant to sign up for another subscription app, I relented and glad I did. The app has a clean interface and a host of interesting options under Settings. Best of all, it works reliably and very responsive. It’s reassuring to know that I can reliably tap into my secret cash stash with confidence without sighted assistance. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a secret.",2022-04-28 14:58:30
Cash Reader for the Blind,I am Blind and this app is a great help less concerned I am being taken advantage of in my giving cash or receiving change back I wish this app could read coins as well since I don’t have the best of feeling in my fingers so I am not always sure what coins I am using or receiving,2022-03-29 11:38:25
Cash Reader for the Blind,If you download this it is not the full version. It will only read small denominations. In order to re-$20 bills and hire you have to purchase the full version. The free version constantly badgers you to upgrade.,2022-01-03 23:10:24
Cash Reader for the Blind,I was out of town for my little cousin’s birthday. I hadn’t had time to fold my money. I had twenties and ones. Good thing I had this app to make sure I didn’t give him a one.,2021-08-17 17:50:35
Cash Reader for the Blind,This app is unreliable. It thought two 1 dollar bills were a 5 and a 10. Do not trust this app; I will be deleting it promptly.,2021-06-18 14:30:57
Cash Reader for the Blind,"This app is incredible. I love how I can scan any kind of money from  around the world and get instant feedback on what the denomination of the cash is. I was sad to see money reader go, but cash reader is the ultamate app for determining the denomination of the bill.  I love the fact that I can just pull out my phone and hold up the bill and immediately get virbal feedback on how much it is worth. For years I have been struggling to find the right app for reading money but now, I don't have to do that anymore. I strongly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or low vision and is tired of fumbleing around with  loose bills or having to ask someone to read your cash to you. It is the best talking money app identifier  out there.  I will never go without my cash reader out and ready to go again.",2021-05-30 10:34:16
Cash Reader for the Blind,I am actually blind and this is a very helpful and useful tool. It’s very convenient and I can read bills anywhere I go,2021-05-11 18:14:21
Cash Reader for the Blind,Great!!!,2021-05-03 16:20:38
Cash Reader for the Blind,"I downloaded the app, gave access to my camera, pointed my camera at the bill, and all I saw was what I normally would say if I were taking a picture of something. I can’t believe they charge for this app. I’m glad I tried out the free version first. And now I see I can’t post a review because the send is blurred out.No matter, I will not be recommending this to my group of 5000 people with low vision",2021-04-04 12:11:01
Cash Reader for the Blind,I absolutely love this app. It is so great for low vision and blind people. It helps when you know the denomination of money that you were holding! Thank you so much…,2021-02-21 18:07:11
Cash Reader for the Blind,Very accurate and a whole lot faster than the other apps that I have paid for. I totally recommend it,2021-01-05 17:41:37
Cash Reader for the Blind,Howdy all I love the app. It easy to use and has cool features that most apps don’t have.,2021-01-02 07:31:53
Cash Reader for the Blind,"This app is super buggy and requires an expensive app purchase to halfway work. It’s not worth downloading much less buying. There’s no shortage of free apps that will read money and much more. Get Seeing AI or AIpoly instead.
  In response to the developer’s response, you clearly misunderstand your market. Lots of free and more functional apps are capable of reading foreign currencies Moreover most other foreign countries have a tactile means of readily identifying all of their currency by touch alone, therefore no app is necessary. America is an outlier in this respect there’s no need for your app in most other countries or the USA. This app is too buggy, too expensive, and a waste of time and money.",2020-09-29 20:38:13
Cash Reader for the Blind,I could easily identify United States currency but all other countries were either no identified or mis identified. Out of the 26 countries of currency I tested only United States and Ukraine was identified. Not worth the purchase for me. Using iPhone 11 Pro Max iOS 13.7.,2020-09-26 11:03:01
Cash Reader for the Blind,"My name is Kevin, I am totally blind. This application is not behaving well. Developer, can you fix this bug.",2020-06-17 01:47:06
Cash Reader for the Blind,"I like the vibration feature, which announces the denomination in a non-verbal way. I also like that you can recognize bills without a data connection. Money Reader could do this, but you can no longer download that from the App Store. Depending on your use case, this may still be a better option, as it recognizes many currencies Money Reader did not. Also, as new bills with different designs come out, since Money Reader is no longer in deveropment apparently, Myoung Reader will likely not recogniue those. This app also does a lot of curency recognition not found in apps such as Seeing AI and iNote. Both of these apps are free, but you get what you pay for.",2020-05-18 11:08:51
Cash Reader for the Blind,Recently I purchased the app. I am very happy to identify very own nepali currency.,2020-05-14 06:42:03

Cash Reader for the Blind,"For now, I am using the 14 day free trial of this app. I have been using the MoneyReader app, but have heard that that might go away eventually, so I wanted to have something else ready for when that eventuality occurred. I downloaded this app, and it works fine, but on the other hand, when I was searching for a dollar bill to be read, it was making up currency denominations just sitting on my couch. I will most likely purchased this app should money reader ever stop working, but for now, I don’t see it being my go to app.",2019-09-22 07:18:25

Cash Reader for the Blind,"This is a wonderful app for blind users. I am an American touring  here in Thailand.  I do not speak much Thai and spoken English here is not spoken regularly either. So, paying bills in a restaurant and receiving Thai currency change  can be an issue at times. However, when I pay my bill and I am given the change in the receipt book I no longer need to hassle with the waitress  to tell me the Thai Boht bills I am handed back to me.
