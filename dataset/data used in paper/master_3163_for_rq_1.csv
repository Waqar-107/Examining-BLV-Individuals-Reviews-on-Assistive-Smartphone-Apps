Be My Eyes,Every time I try to use it to help people out it won’t let me create an account it just says error with no explanation even if I sign up with google/Apple/Facebook,08/30/20 14:10,5,1
Cash Reader for the Blind,This app is unreliable. It thought two 1 dollar bills were a 5 and a 10. Do not trust this app; I will be deleting it promptly.,06/18/21 14:30,5,1
Be My Eyes,"Hey, this to give a tiny winy suggestion. Many people are bilingual,let alone multi-lingual. If the app can have an option of choosing more than 1 language, it'll make reaching out for the people in need more feasible.",04/06/19 1:09,4,4
BlindSquare,"I absolutely love this app. I would give it 10 stars if I could do so. This app helps me every day, and I want to see more continuous work being done to make it even better than it is now. Thank you for such a wonderful app.",03/22/16 15:07,1,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"This is a great app, but I’d like to see two improvements: 1. Allow TalkBack to share images directly with the Images mode. 2. Add a light detecting mode.",11/26/22 3:16,1;4,4
Be My Eyes,"Just signed up as a volunteer, haven't received my first call for help yet, but i love the idea so much, many thanks to the developers😘",03/27/20 9:03,1,5
Be My Eyes,Simple to set up and very easy to begin answering calls and helping people!,11/15/22 22:34,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"I try to start, hit my home button to get the notification and it doesnt do anything but take my to my home screen. Same with lock it, nothing.",01/24/20 9:56,5,1
Be My Eyes,Awesome idea just needs a little better feedback,07/24/22 6:56,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,"First of all, I love this app. I’m only giving a one star review to get the developer’s attention because the video quality has been terrible for the last couple months (probably about 5 calls). It’s really difficult to help people read or decipher things when I can’t get a clear image. I’ve reported problems when asked after each call but haven’t seen any improvement yet so I wanted to note it in my review. I’ve still been able to help a little bit, but it’s been tricky. The video quality wasn’t as bad when I first started using the app so I’m assuming it’s a problem with the app and not my phone. For the record, I’m using an iPhone 8 and have good LTE and WiFi in my house where I get most of my calls. If this is something I can fix on my end, please let me know. Thanks!",04/28/18 22:55,1;3,1
Envision AI,I am happy to create this application many many,04/03/23 7:53,1,5
Be My Eyes,Easy way to help people and share them situations,05/27/21 19:00,2,5
Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer with Be My Eyes. What a wonderful app! It is super easy to use but the help offered can be huge. Such a great service.,01/10/18 0:23,1,5
Be My Eyes,I havent gotten one call and i have had this app for a year.,03/28/20 18:10,2,1
Be My Eyes,I’ve had this app for a few months and only received 2 calls but each time the experience is amazing. Humbling and gives you a sense of purpose to help those who reach out. Highly recommend!!,06/19/23 18:59,1,5
Seeing AI,Amazing implementation of artificial intelligence. I can't imagine a full blown enhances version of this app. It's gonna be amazing.,07/18/17 11:36,1,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,this is an excellent app with a lot of great features.,12/18/23 9:03,1,5
Be My Eyes,Thank you for creating this app what a wonderful resource,07/09/23 1:35,1,4
Be My Eyes,"A good idea, but if anything there are too many helpers. Nearly 6 million volunteers and only 400k needing help. I've had the app 2 months and never had a call. Probably shouldn't take on anymore volunteers.",06/27/22 13:43,1;3,2
OneStep Reader,WARNING! Don't purchase this app. The developers are not updating anymore. Does not work on Android 9 and I have not had any response to my emails.,10/26/18 2:41,3,1
Be My Eyes,This is such a wholesome and amazing idea for an app. I love it so much knowing we can all help each other with just a phone call. God bless the creator and the team!,06/10/22 14:00,1,5
Be My Eyes,"A perfect example of how technology can make a tangible impact

It takes no time - I’ve only had a couple of calls in just over a year - but what an amazing concept, to link those who have sight with those who need sight support sometimes. It’s so simple.

We should have more apps like this, connecting people together that need can benefit from the connection",04/30/23 2:59,2,5
Seeing Eye GPS,"There are just too many flaws with this app in it's current state. BlindSquare does nearly all the same things for a much more affordable, one time price, and it does those things far better. Save your money!",07/04/13 7:28,3,1
Be My Eyes,It is amazing that we can help people!!!! This is so amazing,11/26/22 1:56,1,5

Be My Eyes,This is an incredible idea.,06/06/20 10:17,1,5
Be My Eyes,"It's an amazing app, the only issue it has it that is doesn't work without a vpn in Iran, so if my vpn is off and someone calls, I miss it because vpn also takes time to load. So I have to keep vpn on all the time that eats up my internet. You shouldn't really put sanction and ban on an app like this, really!",03/01/22 2:40,1;3,5
Envision AI,very nice to use tis app.,04/24/19 7:12,1,4
Be My Eyes,Excellent app for helping people who can't see. Glad to have it.,01/23/19 20:20,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Truly an incredible use of technology. I've had the app since it launched in 2017 & I've had the pleasure of answering about 5 calls as a volunteer. I've received more calls than that but I didn't always answer quick enough so the calls went to someone else. I've helped people read instructions, identify colors, & give directions. The calls are usually quick but they are always the highlight of my day. It feels good to help others & reminds me to be grateful for things I often take for granted.",05/24/21 16:19,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"Wow! What a wonderful app! I was able to help two people in a couple of months! Connection was clear, sound sharp! Good feeling at the end!",09/25/22 0:35,1;2,5
Seeing AI,"Just super. Navigation, door cam, and smart glasses support would be super cool.",07/12/17 22:44,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,I wish I got these calls everyday! Soo amazing and love being able to help,02/02/21 18:45,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Even though I don't get a call very often, it makes my day to be able to help others. Kudos to the person(s) that created this app!",12/06/24 22:52,1,5
Be My Eyes,Seems like an awesome iniative and was ready to help. But have not gotten a call since I downloaded it months ago.,06/08/20 14:56,1,3
Be My Eyes,"Great idea, if the app actually worked. Most of the time the answer button does not work. When I can answer it, it turns back off and says error. I can't even use the send us feedback button because it doesn't go anywhere. The app is updated, I have had 2 different phones while also having the app. It has never worked.",11/03/21 21:02,5,1
Be My Eyes,Such an awesome idea. I’ve been a member for years and love every time I’m lucky enough to receive a call!,02/08/24 2:15,1,5
Be My Eyes,Nobody has called me for help!,02/11/20 16:48,3,1
Be My Eyes,It is great know that I can use my sight to help someone who has none.,02/26/20 14:31,1,5
Seeing AI,"I have an iPhone 7 and have the most up-to-date iOS. I find this app to be more of a pain in the butt to try to get it to function than it is helpful. I just spent 15 minutes attempting to find out what this box of medication is, and I am still without an answer. This is not the only example of the trouble I regularly have with this app; it is just The most recent incident.
 I don’t know if other users who’ve written reviews are paid by Microsoft or are using non-Apple products with the app, but I find it to be far more of a hassle than the TapTapSee app, which is still pretty darn sucky.",08/04/19 20:55,3,1
Seeing AI,Woow I wish I had this 2 years ago I scanned my son and it said his age  we were amazed I got this because it’s hard for me to see specially in the store great app you must get,02/20/20 18:07,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"I got my very first call today! It was a very nice young guy that needed me to read what his bathroom scale was telling him. Turns out it needed a new battery. It was so simple, but so fulfilling and heartwarming to help somebody with the simplest task. This app is amazing.",01/28/24 12:32,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,It helps me feel the best in giving back to such a large and bright community.,06/12/18 15:29,1,5
Be My Eyes,Fantastic app. I am a sighted person and have had numerous interactions with sight impared people around the world.,10/10/20 16:11,1,5
Be My Eyes,I would love to use the app to get started to help people but I forgot I had made an account with my email a few years ago but didn’t verify it in time before it expired and don’t see a way to get a new one because I get instantly logged out since the email wasn’t verified. Is there a way I can get a new email verification link so I can start assisting others?,10/28/22 17:39,3,3
Be My Eyes,My wife gets lots of calls and I get hardly any. Feels good to help someone out.,09/22/22 11:19,1;2,5
OneStep Reader,Why would u make us install it and then u wont let us do anything,12/18/19 8:21,-1,1
Be My Eyes,great idea but a pointless app.I haven't had a single call in 4 months..so it's literally just taking up space on my phone.as it does not work for anything else..too bad..,05/22/19 0:40,1;3,1
Be My Eyes,Simply doesn't do anything. Installed multiple times. Test call doesn't work. Never get any request,09/12/23 15:13,3,1
Be My Eyes,Very nice. Can receive assistance almost whenever I need it. Occasional he no volunteer answers. Sometimes have trouble with video quality. But very good experiences overall.,11/06/20 15:31,1;3,4
Be My Eyes,"I’ve received countless notifications that someone needs help and I click on it straightaway and as soon as I get into the app, it says someone else has taken the call despite the fact I clicked on the notification as it popped up while I was on my phone.

As long as the people need help are getting it, that’s what’s important but I’m deleting it cause I don’t think there are plenty of people to help and don’t need this many users.",01/22/23 11:22,3,3
Be My Eyes,"I don't get calls often, but this app is solid and helpful",04/26/20 16:09,1,5
Be My Eyes,This is a brilliant way to connect with and help others!,08/26/22 14:40,1,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app! My son sends me letters and I can't read them. But with this app I can! Thank you thank you thank you!,07/05/24 11:08,1;2,5
Envision AI,"I love this app! Great job! I am noticing the smoothness of the speech at line breaks is a little long, the numbers under a barcode are read as a full number at first but then as individual numbers, there's nothing to let you know how a found item will signal with the beep before it happens, the ai description is accurate. I've only tried those 3 functions so far but I'm excited to try what else it can do. Thanks!",01/09/25 5:48,2;4,5
Be My Eyes,"Had this app installed for over a month and never got a single request for help from a kind person. Would’ve loved to help, but it just takes up storage space on my phone.",11/07/21 19:49,1;3,1
Be My Eyes,"Really cool platform of you're looking for a way to do some good for other people. The app can be glitchy sometimes and has cause me to miss a call or lose signal, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Usually not a big deal as there's probably someone else in line ready to take the call. I've had calls about distinguishing packaging, choosing patterns, and researching HR initiatives. Once I even explained the purpose of the app to someone whose kid had installed it for them!",05/27/22 5:51,1;3,4
TapTapSee,"It works fine now on none flash devices, thanks for update!",02/09/13 5:50,1;3,5
Envision AI,One of the nice apps I've ever come across,03/07/21 6:36,1,5
Be My Eyes,Hey can take a while sometimes to get a helper but it's amazing that so many people have signed up to help and it's really invaluable when a person needs some eyeballs and you're able to get it from your phone,03/12/15 16:58,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Phone rings, I’m busy I take the call. Cool guy just needed to know which one was speed wash on his gadget was on or off took 5.6 seconds. He had a speed wash and I felt I contributed to humanity for 10 seconds.",04/21/19 11:37,1;2,5
Seeing AI,Thanks so much for creating this! Keep up the great work!,07/16/17 2:18,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This is the best app I've ever had. Incredibly simple, practical and useful. I'm very happy to be a helpful volunteer.",02/14/18 11:37,1,5
Be My Eyes,No option to select multiple languages for multilingual people. Limits scope of help.,01/09/22 14:16,4,3
Be My Eyes,My rating is based on the concept alone.,02/19/20 21:00,-1,4
Be My Eyes,What a wonderful concept. Very easy to download the app and get set up. I had my first call and wow how amazing it was that I could be of service to someone in another state/ time zone. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to sign up and be of service.,01/14/18 3:36,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"There's a flaw with the app, there's no way to write what time we're available and I think maybe if you don't pick up once it doesn't count you as a valid helper anymore. Soon after I installed it, I missed a call that came in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. And since then (months ago) nothing.",05/05/23 4:32,3,3
Be My Eyes,Its a really good apo and it is helpful for those in need but i have been on this app since december 2019 and ive yet to recive a call and its kinda dissapointing because ive waited for so long and there are so many people on the app and yet so little people that need help i think you guys can do better tbh,03/11/20 13:33,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"Whoever created this app , I love you . Such a helpful app and it brightens my day being able to help others . 🫶🏼",08/11/22 13:51,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I got my first call last week. It was a video chat with a man who got a new watch and needed to set it to speak instead of being read only. It took about twenty minutes because I had to Google the manual and walk him through it. When we finally got it working, he was so happy and excited. It felt so nice hearing the excitement in his voice. It's easy to help! Since there are so many volunteers, you won't be overloaded with calls. I've had it for a month but have only received two calls. Somebody else beat me to answering the first one, but I was able to get this one first. The calls ring on the phones of multiple volunteers and the first one to answer gets to take it, so no one is left hanging if you can't answer.",12/21/17 23:44,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,Not starting using now that why I give you 2rate,04/30/23 2:11,-1,2

BlindSquare,"This app is trying to be a better version of around meGPS, and my way  However, it is doing none of them really well. This app reads to you in a non-voiceover voice locations nearby. It does a good job of using the foursquare database to find locations that are near you. However, the filtering, targeting, and other features are hard to get at.  Especially, when the app is reading to you.  Also, it's integration with voiceover is poor. The volumes of  voices can be different, they can be reading at the same time, and other problems come up. 

In short, the app is hard to use, uses an unnecessary voice, and is not doing what is been designed to do. We should wait and see what happens next but this is not worth $12 right now",05/26/12 16:05,3,1
Be My Eyes,Great concept but calls seem to be coming from sighted people looking to sexually harass others. There has to be a better way to do this.,09/17/19 6:28,1;6,2

Be My Eyes,Putting others first with this app. Brilliant,12/15/17 9:33,1,5
Be My Eyes,"It’s fantastic being able to help people across the globe! Requests don’t come frequently - I think it’s due to the fact that there are more volunteers than people needing support (which is in fact, awesome).
Hope more people needing help can have access and use this tool in their lives!",06/08/22 14:29,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,This is the perfect app to assist others in need right from your home or office!,04/29/22 18:59,1,5
Be My Eyes,This app is so cool to me that anyone anywhere can help anyone somewhere else through their phone. I’ve answered 2 calls now and it the most exciting thing. It brightened my day more than anyone else’s and I highly recommend this app.,10/16/19 18:31,1,5

TapTapSee,I like this app. Amusing,12/10/14 4:06,1,5
OneStep Reader,I didn't read the reviews warning this is a scam but it is. If your product was good you wouldn't hide behind a paywall every single feature. That's not just shady but it's dumb. Not shockingly this app shared results in my googling with the also terrible Speechify,04/08/23 10:32,3,1
Be My Eyes,Thanks to Be My Eyes team for their efforts in helping those in need.,11/28/21 10:43,1,5

Be My Eyes,"There are some issues which need to be fixed for better volunteer experience. 1- If the call is already picked , The ring should be stopped for everyone else , It keeps on ringing and is very irritating if i am not near the phone. 2- It should not ring if i am already on a phone call. If these ossues get fixed , This app will be a heaven for both the needy and the volunteers.",11/20/24 4:30,3,3

Be My Eyes,"I like Be My Eyes. It has been very helpful for me to have volunteers that read things for me. However, I used it this morning to read a prescription label. It did not read the prescription that was in front of me. It seems to be holding onto memories of reading a previous prescription. It’s very dangerous to have this app telling me. I’m taking one medication when I’m actually taking another. I don’t know what the deal is, but there’s no chance that it mistakenly read the wrong thing. The prescription at red was not even in the open. It was in a box. This is dangerous if you plan on it, keeping you safe.",03/02/25 14:28,1;5;6,3
Be My Eyes,"I got this app the first time I seen it come out. I was excited about being able to help.  Before I could really understand the app & what was happening, I had already gotten a call. So, without knowing what to do, I let someone else take the call. Before day 2 & 3 I had gotten 3-4 more calls. I still did not know what I was doing, so I contacted the app techs and asked for help & explained my situation.  After a few minutes he came back to me, and told me I’d get it, and not to worry about it. 
     Well, after that day through the next year plus I never received a call.  So I took the app off. If the app isn’t going to benefit me, or if I’m unable to use the app to help someone else, I don’t need the app to just be taking up space.",10/17/19 20:48,2,3
Be My Eyes,I’ve had the app for about 6mts now and I final answered my first call! It was a teacher who wanted to demonstrate how the app worked for one of her students. Regardless it was amazing! I love helping people!,06/25/22 2:56,1,5

I was able to help someone find clorox wipes. I'm so glad this app exists.,03/17/21 12:05,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Amazing Concept I find this concept really amazing. However my phone is on vibrate 90% of the time and calls don't vibrate on this. It would be good if it showed a notification during a call as they can be used by many as a trigger for different actions.

The picture function that is suppose to make what you’re viewing more clear, either doesn’t load the picture at all, or when it does, the picture is just as blurry as the resolution if the video call. This problem defeats the purpose this app was created for, as I was not able to help people due to the poor resolution.

Lookout - Assisted vision,Application is good. I have to use it in Pakistan but Urdu language and Pakistani currency is not included. App may not detect urdu & also PKR. So app is useless for me until developers add these two options. Thanks,08/17/22 18:47,4,4

The only thing that I would say I would like to have if it’s even possible is I have a very hard time with expiration dates I always have to have someone come down and read it for me and I have not found a single app that has been able to find and read expiration dates don’t know if that’s possible if not that’s fine it would just be nice thing to have I’m even very skeptical about eating things in my fridge and pantry just because I don’t know if it’s any good or not and I don’t wanna have to call someone to say hey can you come tell if this is good or not so it definitely is a real problem for me don’t really know what else to do so if that is a feature that is possible to be added it would be great but again I very much love this app it has made my life so much easier thank you again,04/25/21 0:33,4,5

The relatively new AI feature is truly amazing and everybody needs to learn how to use it effectively. That’s sad on the occasions. I’ve had trouble reaching Volunteer in a timely manner. The AI feature has worked really well to guide me.

My only suggestion is that they remove the comment section after a session has ended as I’ve had almost 0 problems with  it. It would be better just to have the option to submit a report if anyone needs to rather than being forced to by having to complete it by selecting I had problems or I had a good session.",02/19/25 20:08,1;3;4,5

TapTapSee,I appreciate this app. It has been successful in identifying things for me. Many Thanks :-),05/02/14 11:25,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I recently read about someone who had troubles getting help because nobody answered. Well, I always try to answer, but I have to unlock my phone first. By the time I get it unlocked, the call has been passed to someone else. If I have more than a few seconds to answer, I would be able to answer more often. It would be great if the request came through as a FaceTime call; I think I don’t have to unlock my phone for that. Furthermore, I would be more useful if I could set my app to available or unavailable when I’m sitting idle or driving. Because of the issues I have answering and the rarity of requests, I have often considered deleting the app altogether. 
 Other than my two complaints, I have enjoyed the app. I really enjoyed helping the two folks I was able to assist. I’ll be honest, I get really excited when the opportunity to help someone arises. Helping others is what I enjoy most in life, but I would like more opportunities to do so. Thank you to the creators of Be My Eyes for creating something so wonderful.

Be My Eyes,"It's a great idea, I haven't answered a call yet, but the only reason I gave 4 stars is because apparently the app has to be open to get calls, at least that's how I saw it works on my phone. I left the app open and I got my first call in the morning (I didn't receive any since I downloaded the app) and while I was at he dentist I couldn't answer at the time. So my guess is that it only works if it's open, would be great if you could fix it.",08/05/20 20:25,1,4

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I originally downloaded this app before it was a monthly or yearly subscription. Like others I find it disappointing that it is now subscription based for something that was free.  I also find it frustrating to use as it doesn’t lock the camera on the walk sign and as you walk it loses what it sees from natural normal movements. It also seems inconsistent at lights. I’ve crossed a couple lights 2 it handled as best as it could considering the previously stated locking issues, then I crossed at a major intersection and it completely failed and didn’t notify me when I could walk at all it just went silent. Thankfully I had other support but for something I am paying to use this should not be an issue what so ever. The inconsistencies are concerning at best.",02/09/25 21:59,3,3

Maybe you could make it where it’ll say a little more to the right down up left right and then it would say move the phone away from the text and then eventually it would just say hold steady and take the picture
And when I hold my phone in front of text for short text it’s just reads about a quarter of the text and it makes no sense because it puts it in different orders and it makes no sense to me

And for my book reader when I hold it in front of the barcode it starts making big score faster and faster and then but it never takes the picture of the beeps just freeze and the app crash crashes
What I’m trying to say is when I hold the phone over a barcode the beeps just get faster but then when it’s about to take the picture of the beep slow down and then stop and the app restarts so please make these updates right away I mean right now",12/10/19 23:47,3,2

I wish the software could be rewritten or that the app could be written better.",01/27/22 12:15,1;3,2
Be My Eyes,"First off; great job to the developer and their team. I can’t even say anything good (that’s new lol) about this system that hasn’t been said before a million people. I hope this app continues to serve and connect people and even get better at doing that as time goes by.

Which is why I thought I’d mention a couple ideas I thought the developer might find worthwhile implementing:

1. This would take minimal effort, but; I just thought it would be a good setting to add to the app to put volunteer status “on hold” at designated times the user inputs, rather than having to manually log out and log back in every day so you don’t get a notification or call when you’re sleeping, in school, etc., and keeps people from having to remember to sign in every time.
2. General Tasks Descriptions/Specialty Knowledge Requests: I think adding a small list of general description scenarios (perhaps coordinating them to a number, and not speaking any number when making a call would just be usual “miscellaneous” as is) might help to give volunteers a better idea of wether they would be a great/best-avoided choice for the task at hand (under the not-so-common scenarios, it could probably save time for the requesters and volunteers from cycling through a match that can get the objective done; when a particularly special knowledge event requires assistance). This could maybe even go further by giving volunteers skill tables to be able to fill in; and when a special request call requiring knowledge in that field is made, volunteers with knowledge in that field could be alerted first. Example: Something like a “computer science” tag and if a visually disabled person needed a pair of eyes to identify what is keeping them from navigating a voice controlled computer as normal, but a large amount of volunteers might need to also know how to navigate Windows 10 task manager, etcetera. 
Not a perfect example, but my point is just that if the developer and team has the resources and inspiration; perhaps something among those lines are a couple ideas of how they could continue to better the app and keep the world community doing the good stuff it does.

Be My Eyes,"I went to sign up as a sighted person, but the app demands access to my camera. I can't understand why it would need video of what's going on at my end, and it smells of spyware.",06/04/16 19:09,6,1
Be My Eyes,Fabulous way to be of service. Only downside is that so many people are helping that I don't get as many calls as I would like. Love this app and love helping folk.,08/17/16 17:39,1;3,5
Be My Eyes,"As soon as I saw this app I knew I wanted to be a part of it. The chance to help people and do something good for somebody, anywhere, anytime of day. I’ve been looking at more apps that are similar, but there’s not many especially like this one. I love it!",05/09/19 18:09,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is super easy to use and a great way to help others from wherever you are.

Be My Eyes,"Great app, easy to use and easy to help",11/04/23 6:49,1,5
Be My Eyes,Over the past year I’ve received about 6 calls from people needing assistance. I’ve helped people with things as simple as does this shirt match this skirt or what is the name on this perfume bottle. What a brilliant concept this is..it takes just a few minutes to help someone but the feeling you’re left with afterwards lasts a lot longer than that. 💗💗💗,03/29/18 14:05,2,5
Be My Eyes,"Got my first call today! Was a very good experience, someone needed help reading labels. Only reason not 5 stars is because the video lagged badly, which made it take more time to read for the person. Had a good connection with audio, and was connected via wifi, so not sure what the vid issue was",11/21/20 21:05,1;3,4

Be My Eyes,"I keep trying to sign up to become a volunteer, but my request always times out. Do you know how to fix this?",08/27/20 17:50,5,4
Be My Eyes,The app is very dodgy collection of all your movements. You can do the same with whatdapp video and atleast there you know who is guiding you. Why have a app that you entrust all your privacy in the hands of foreign people. Try whatsapp for that purpose let your family and friends be your eyes..,04/26/20 17:54,6,5

Be My Eyes,Is there no way to set a schedule to not get calls at 4am? Then become available again the next day? Just a thought...,10/06/17 21:23,3;4,3
OneStep Reader,You need to provide a at least a free might be limited time option to at least test the product. I don't mind investing in an app but I need to see first if it's what I need. I tried taking a photo on the app but I'm getting grayed out icons that I can't seem to take a snap or. do anything.,07/15/21 15:53,5,1

Be My Eyes,"I really love the idea of this app and was looking forward to being able to help others. 

However since may last year, I have only had the opportunity to help 1 person. 

How do you evenly spread the calls across volunteers? Is it based on algorithms?",02/06/23 13:50,1,2
TapTapSee,This app so brilliant. So small too. Must have. I will give 5 if we can copy the result text and have history about the result. Even in the paid version i will buy it,07/29/15 7:25,1,4
Seeing AI,"This app was great until recently. I used this app to scan money, scan products, and read text, but the recent updates have made it very terrible for me. You can no longer do money scanning on the app, and they took away the really short text feature, so now you have to take a picture of the document which is not easy for some people, even with the camera help. Seeing AI team, If you see this, please bring back the old features of the app.",03/14/25 21:19,3;4,2
Envision AI,"When I install an app, I want to be given a choice whether and when to start a limited time free trial, and for contact info to be easily accessible without requesting a call back. None of this was able to happen. As soon as I set up, my 14 day free trial was under way with no way to stop it. That kind of aggressiveness earns a spot on my permanent ban list. In that area Envision AI has succeeded. Be careful when installing if you are not quite ready. Your countdown begins immediately. In my world, not good business practice.",10/30/19 18:03,3,1

Envision AI,"I got this app, because I thought this would work for me! However, I have the trial basis. No problem there! However it told me my trial has ended. So I purchased the cheapest one I can get. The one $ one. Is telling me that I should get the $13 one, I am on a fixed income, and it’s too expensive for me. I am not happy with this app at all one bit. LJ not happy",01/06/22 13:20,3,3

Be My Eyes,"Can’t say too much about how well the App works. As I’ve only been contacted for help about 4 times and only once did I actually connect to assist.
And that’s over about a 3-4 year period(I’ll come back to this in a bit).

It’s an absolutely great idea of how to improve people’s day to day lives. With minimal impact on either party.

How great is it to have a simple App that allows a person to gain almost instant assistance. Without the need for anyone to be around.
As soon as heard about this App I downloaded. Just thought, why wouldn’t you sign up to help others especially when you don’t really have to do that much.

However as my title say, you gotta let people know about this App. And not only people with sight but with people with sight issues.
There are just short of a million helps signed up but only 67k people with sight issues. And that’s are figures for worldwide. Hence why I’ve had so few people call for assistance.

So, download the App. Tell people about it and get them to do likewise. Please.",04/11/18 6:56,1,5

I just spent 15 minutes attempting to find out what this box of medication is, and I am still without an answer. This is not the only example of the trouble I regularly have with this app; it is just The most recent incident.
 I don’t know if other users who’ve written reviews are paid by Microsoft or are using non-Apple products with the app, but I find it to be far more of a hassle than the TapTapSee app, which is still pretty darn sucky.",08/04/19 13:55,3,1

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This app was recommended to me by my mobility trainer after a really scary intersection, crossing in the middle of a big city with a crosswalk that did not make any sound when it was time to cross. I love having this when I have to cross intersections that are not disability friendly. My only complaint is that different lighting situations are not reliable, and if there are more than a few lanes, the app sometimes just continuously says it’s not safe to Cross? instead of simply telling me that it’s not workin",05/10/24 19:00,2;5,4

i have a couple issues, one is that you can't set the ringtone or volume for the calls from the app. the notification for a phone call is not very loud, so it would be nice to have settings for that. 

also my last phone call i was unable to turn on the callers' phone light or take a picture with their phone. so yeah just some fine tuning can be done but otherwise what a positive way to use technology!",08/04/23 3:00,1;3,4

I just signed up for it yesterday and I received my first phone call today. Unfortunately, it was a group of people pranking me and laughing off camera. I am very disappointed in the app. I’m giving it one star for now because it was my first caller, but I will change it depending on whether I receive calls from people who truly need this service. I don’t know if there is a way to accurately screen the people who are signing up claiming to have a visual impairment versus a vile person just doing it for a laugh.

Be My Eyes,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE join this free app and support those with sight problems. 

Imagine you lost your sight even partly and could not do your daily tasks as easily anymore. Imagine someone (a random stranger) not only could help, but WANTED to!! 

This is the best app for anyone with sight issues to be easily assisted in fulfilling a self sufficient lifestyle. My only negative is as there are now so many volunteers signed up, I don’t get nearly as many calls as I would like. 

In my opinion everyone that is fully sighted, should be signed up to this to be eligible for free NHS treatment. Be kind. Give back.

Be My Eyes,"My favorite part of this app is the artificial intelligence image recognition model that was added recently. However, it also has its problems. Today, my mom and I went out to IHOP for brunch. I scanned the menu with my phone and asked my AI to describe the menu. it told me that the pancake of the month was a stack of buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup and a dollop of butter. But when the waiter brought up my food, she brought out a stack of pancakes with raspberry sauce on top. Turns out the pancake of the month was actually a stack of raspberry pancakes. The AI model had made a mistake when describing the menu. I personally love open AI, I use ChatGPT all the time. I was surprised that such an advanced image recognition model could mess up like that. I hope you guys improve the AI model you put in this app, and I hope you get rid of some bugs, and hopefully this model will be better at reading menus",05/05/24 17:06,2;3,3

Envision AI,"First, thanks to the developers of envision AI for staying so engaged with the user community and constantly making the app better. It is really a valuable tool! My favorite thing about this app is the document scanner. It is by far the most accurate OCR I’ve ever experienced on my iPhone. A couple years ago I purchased something called KNFB reader which if I recall was like $100 and it cannot compete with envision OCR. The instant text feature can be very useful but I feel it also has room for further development. It continuously re-scans what you are aiming it at, sometimes resulting in garbled output, and it constantly cuts off and interrupts its own output even if you barely move your phone. It’s really a game of seeing if you can make out what it says well enough to at least accomplish the task. For example, if I aim it at a carton that I pull out of the fridge and I hear something that sounds similar to “milk” or “half-and-half,” I know what I’ve just grabbed, but I really think it could work a lot more smoothly. I have a suggestion – somehow combine the object recognition and instant text technologies such that the instant text reader has some awareness of what you are pointing it at. In my milk carton example, it would know that it’s reading within the bounds of that object which might help it focus. Along similar lines, I have a heck of a time getting it to read LCD screens on home appliances and electronics. I wish there was a way you could tell it to recognize an LCD screen and have it only focus on text that appears on that screen. This is a suggestion I made a while back and it hasn’t been implemented yet, but I can’t imagine others wouldn’t find it helpful. Giving it five stars because overall I still think it’s outstanding, but I hope to see it continue to improve. Thank you",07/30/22 15:01,1;5,5

audio and I didn't know what input I was on made the call to be my eyes and 
the agent was highly professional and very helpful this app is highly 
recommended",05/27/18 8:57,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,A beautiful use of technology. Helping others is what life is all about.,11/14/18 21:52,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This is a great way to lend your abilities to others who are visually challenged. I have helped callers read an expiration date on food, describe their building so they can call for pick up, and even find Takis in a convenience store. A perfect use of technology to lift people up!",06/01/20 13:44,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Magnificent idea Hope to add more options for more specification to make the people who needs help more comfortable Like gender even helper or requester, geographic area, age range As this may give both parts of the call more relieved and not being shy specifically girls as they have more private needs which men might not be able to understand or fulfill",05/20/21 10:27,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,"A great and easy way to help someone. I really like this app, it's not overbearing by any means (as in not constant notificatios) and the people are always kind :)",04/07/23 11:02,1,5
Be My Eyes,This app was a wonderful idea from the beginning. It is wonderful and helpful for those who are aware of the app. There’s so many people ready to help I’ve only been able to help around 8 since 2019,09/20/24 17:29,1,4
Be My Eyes,Very exciting can't wait to help.,03/05/20 11:36,1,5
Be My Eyes,How could anyone rate such a great app less than 5 stars.,06/14/20 4:44,1,5
Be My Eyes,What an amazing app! This is such a blessing to be able to assist another human in daily life.,09/17/21 17:44,1,5
Be My Eyes,"When it works, helpful. The button to report a problem doesn't work at all. So cannot report that I can't hear anyone. Skews deliberately to only positive responses.",10/29/24 11:27,5,3
OneStep Reader,"This is an incredibly powerful, accurate and user-friendly app. I have used Claro-read on my PC for several years and this is definitely up there with it in the quality stakes. The great advantage is that I can dip in and out of books and skim read like other students, without having to scan entire chapters as PDFs first. You can even use it in the library with a pair of headphones. Stunning. The only thing I would improve is the functionality for saving documents you have just scanned/red, which I haven’t got my head round yet. (48 hours after downloading, still head over heels in the honey moon!)",11/28/18 12:50,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for over a month. I got 1 call the first day, but I didn't catch it in time. I haven't gotten any since 😔 But I love the idea of the app ❤️",11/12/22 19:30,1,2
Be My Eyes,"I am changing my review from five stars to one star because of a few issues.
One. Camera. I’m not exactly sure why but when I have called volunteers, they say that my camera is having focus issues.
Too. Ringer sound when trying to connect to a volunteer. I’m not sure what’s going on but I have to press the volume up buttons on my phone to even find out if the ringing sound is going on. I’ve checked all settings and everything seems to be correct. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled this app with no success.
Three. Contacting Be My Eyes themselves for other organizations to be included such as Logitech, Bose, and even Apple accessibility to name a few. Whenever I email Be My Eyes, all I get in reply is just the same email that I’ve sent to them with information about the operating system I’m running on my iPhone which at the current time of this writing is iOS 18.3 and I’m on an iPhone SE three.
I’m hoping someone Will look at this review and might be able to tell me what is going on.",03/19/25 17:14,3,1

Be My Eyes,Its great being able to help people.,02/04/22 21:30,1,5
Be My Eyes,Just had my first call since downloading the app nearly a year ago. A gentleman in Alberta Canada had lost his wallet in his house. So lovely to be able to help in some small way. It was only after I thought that maybe some people may make the call because they are lonely or sad and wouldn’t it be nice if you could keep in touch with some of the people you’ve helped. Just a thought.,05/23/19 15:08,1;2,5
Envision AI,amazing app - wow! it is sooooo good 👌😎,04/18/19 6:37,1,5

Be My Eyes,I love it I like helping people,11/08/19 14:51,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Already received two calls from people needing assistance. I'll be honest, 
it's such a fulfilling feeling knowing not only that you helped someone 
when they really needed it, but that by helping them you instill the 
confidence in them that there are always those willing to lend a hand. I 
will keep this app on every device I ever own, and promote it as long as my 
voice will allow. With all the games and stupid rinky-dink apps out there, 
it's infinitely rewarding to have one that actually and directly effects 
people who need help. All the kudos I have go to the developers.",04/23/18 13:46,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I'm happy to help others, and this is a clean, simple, and effective tool to do so.

Be My Eyes,I answered my first call for help today and it was nothing short of amazing. The feeling I got after connecting with and helping another person across the country is one I can’t describe. I can’t wait to see the notification pop up for my second call! This is the easiest way to help another person I’ve ever seen. 100% worth it!,10/22/22 3:22,1,5
Be My Eyes,This app fills my heart with joy.,03/02/20 1:24,1,5
Be My Eyes,Love this app and the concept! I’ve had this app for a little over a year now and I’ve only been able to answer 3 calls which is bitter sweet. I wish I answered in time for more. But I love this,04/21/21 10:28,1,5

Be My Eyes,I went to answer and app did not work,02/21/19 16:17,5,2
Be My Eyes,I love this app every time I need help I get a volunteer fairly quickly and I get the help. I need very quickly. The volunteers are excellent at what they do in a bubble it’s free. I love the fact that the virtual AI is coming out and I can’t wait to see how it works.,08/09/23 14:43,1,5
Be My Eyes,It's a great way to help and give back to society especially for people who don't have time to physically attend other volunteering activities. The platform is user-friendly and I don't have issues with the call quality.,03/09/23 23:20,1,5

Be My Eyes,The single most wholesome app I've ever encountered,02/13/22 7:00,1,5
Seeing AI,I use this app daily to get around and interpret my surroundings.  It’s the biggest reason I’ve stuck with iPhones because it’s exclusive to iPhone.,03/17/20 19:16,2,5

Even with something very simple. Very gratifying",06/03/18 5:41,1,5
Envision AI,"Hello. I’ve been using this app for a while and really like a lot of its features. I have noticed, though that the barcodes that are in the app are kind of limited. It does need some extensive work in the barcode scanner department. I had a bottle of shampoo that I was scanning, and when I read the barcode, it said it was a tube of toothpaste. Not quite sure what’s going on there.",03/04/23 9:49,5,5
Be My Eyes,"Still have these issues: [Volunteer] I think this is such a great service for the disabled to be able to more safely navigate a world that won't accommodate them 🙏🏽 But I haven't received a call in several months, now, and I don't know why. I used to have weeks between calls, but for some reason I haven't gotten any requests for a long while now. My app is up-to-date and so is my info, I've had positive experiences as a volunteer, and I've been able to help most if not all who've called, too.",12/17/23 15:58,1,4
Be My Eyes,"I signed up July of 2019 and have helped at least 10 people so far. (May 2024) It seems the more you engage with the app, the more likely you are to get calls. It's a great feeling!",05/24/24 19:52,1,5
Be My Eyes,I signed up and less than 1 hr I received a call. I haven't had a problem from this app. I really love that the developer has made this app free. There are a lot of people out there who could really benefit from using this app,01/17/15 8:08,1,5
BlindSquare,"I bought this app yesterday, and I cannot feel happier. I really wanted to enhance my navigation skills and this app is feature rich. I am glad that this app is updated frequently, and I hope that it won't discontinue like Soundscape, because it was the closest comparison from this app. again, thank you.",02/08/23 14:27,1,5

Be My Eyes,"It's been a smooth and interesting navigation using the be my eyes app. Decided volunteers treat us with care and respect. But I would like them to have an introductory statement like: This is be my eyes, my name is..... This will add colour to their responses. And also redirect calls made in error.",09/26/24 3:26,1;4,4
Be My Eyes,This is such a great way to help your fellow man or woman. It is easy. You just have to to answer the questions that are asked and maybe have the person adjust the camera. It is really rewarding. Try it!,06/07/20 3:15,2,5

Be My Eyes,"Just singed up to be a volunteer so I havnt even received my first call to be of help to someone nevertheless, I am so excited to be able to provide such simple yet vital aid to another induvidual in need. Very quick set up that took may be 4 min total, including doing a practice of how to answer a call and watching the very breif video within that practice. We need more apps such as this to better the world around us; and not the thousands of mindless/pointless apps without a shred of purpose",12/21/20 11:46,2,5

TapTapSee,"App used to work great. You could take a picture of just about anything(shirt, pair shoes, dresser, etc.), The app would be quick and accurate about getting back to you with what you were looking at. Regularly, I would use TapTapSee to sort through my paper money, never had any problems. About 2 to 3 weeks ago, I went to use the app for the purpose of sorting through my cash, and something had changed. Now instead of taking a picture of paper currency, and being told that I have either a one dollar bill, or say a $20 bill, I am told that I am looking at a grey and white stamp, or A piece of textile, or maybe even a pink wallet, even though there may be nothing of the sort in the picture.

I used to be able to depend on this app. Now I’ve come to depend on my phones magnifier, Which is much more time-consuming, plus the fact that I do not like to depend on what I’m looking at.",01/26/19 2:45,1,1

Be My Eyes,"I signed up a few months ago and a month later I got my first call. I was really excited. But once the guy started talking to me, it felt more like a scam. He was talking about how he had hardly any money and didn’t know what to do. And he kept talking about it to the point it seemed like he wanted me to send him money. And he was walking around a park and he seemed to know where he was going while he was walking around. There would be things in the way and he would walk over them without using a walking stick. Like he could see... the whole encounter felt odd",11/19/21 3:53,6,1

This sort of thing restores faith in app creators that it’s not always about selling imaginary gold coins or heavy advertising. 
Long may it last and look forward to helping those that need it.",01/21/25 1:38,-1,5

Be My Eyes,I got my first call after 2 years with this app and was IN TEARS because it wouldn't connect. I felt so helpless knowing someone was trying to get help and we couldn't get connected.

Be My Eyes,"I have had the opportunity to answer a call twice. The first time I was helping a gentleman with a clock. I caught myself saying “.do you see this button” and of course quickly realize how dumb I sounded and needed to find other ways to describe like “there’s a button on the left of it, try to feel for it…”. He was very appreciative and didn’t seem frustrated by my “do you see” comments. The second time was a woman going out for the evening and had some top laid out on the bed to match her pants. This time I was sure to be careful with my choice of words. We had a lovely chat and I helped her pick her outfit. Both times only took maybe 10 minutes and I’m sure I got more out of it then the folks I helped did. Both times when I hung up, I gave thanks for the health of my eyes, something most of us take for granted daily. Way to go Be My Eyes! Lucie H.",01/02/24 3:46,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,While the AI is great there is lots of room for improvements. Things to consider for future updates. *Save the photo for future use *Save the response as a wav file for further reference. *Zoom in on the photo *Ask a question before you take the photo eg Tell me which is the container with biscuits? Rather than having to listen to everything in the photo then asking your question. *Have dark theme option and bigger font. *Have the text read aloud as soon as it appears. *Fix feedback function,12/16/23 2:22,4,3

Be My Eyes,"I can tell that the app authors have really worked hard on this app. Very simple and intuitive. I've used it since March 2015, and had about 23 alerts (roughly once every 2 months), and I was able to answer it in time about 6 times. Wonderful experience every time!

So far I helped people with mac-n-cheese directions, TV menu settings, oven temperature, clothing colors, and webpage fine-print. 

I think the only feature request is some configuration on TIME OF DAY. The standard settings only allow you to receive calls between 8am and 9pm (08:00-21:00) in your local time zone, which is fine for me. But I feel it should be a configurable option.

Also, it might be nice for volunteers to list their various skills, and then callers could optionally request skills. E.g. techie, fashion, color recognition, cooking, lengthy request, mathematics, regional info (by city?), or other special interests.",01/11/19 3:09,2,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such a simple yet genius idea, and it works so easily and well! As a sighted but chronically ill person, I often feel like I’m not able to help others as much as I’d like, and this app gives me an opportunity to help in a way that I can, from my own home. It is so fulfilling to help a stranger, even in such a small, mundane way, and it reminds me that we all have things to be grateful for.",03/10/22 20:30,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Such a wonderful idea! I've only been able to answer one call so far since they seem to be picked up really fast! But the video quality can be improved slightly. Other than that, a great initiative.",09/27/21 10:50,1,4

Be My Eyes,got my first call within a day of downloading the app. it’s only been 1.5 months and I’ve had two calls total. Both were great and I actually had the opportunity to chat with the second user for a while after I assisted them and it was very heartwarming for the both of us. would totally recommend for both seeing and visually impaired people. five stars for sure!,12/23/20 4:57,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded this app years ago and have kept it on my phone no matter what. Over those years I have only received maybe 10 calls, most which I was able to answer and aide the person on the other end of the call. Each phone call, no matter how brief or long, has been a delightful “interruption” to my days. Taking a moment out of my time to help someone pick out the right color sweater to match their pants, or set their washer to the right settings, or take their evening stroll with them, helps me reflect on those little things so many of us otherwise take for granted each day. Reminds me to pause and be grateful for the moment. For what we have, and what we don’t have. To just be present. So I just wanted to say thank you to whoever created this app because this is truly something remarkable and beautiful. You’ve helped me see with more than just my eyes, and to share my gift of vision with others. Thank you.",06/05/23 20:15,2,5
Be My Eyes,"Download this app - and watch how your life changes from small acts of kindness. 

Be My Eyes is designed to have volunteers assist visually impaired individuals with daily tasks - simply by answering a call from someone who is blind or has low vision. The camera is not activated on your end, just for the individual you are assisting. I’ve helped people sort laundry, pick out a tie to match their shirt, read expiration dates, and so many other small tasks that are challenging for the individual I’m working with. If you receive a call and are unable to take it, no need to worry - another volunteer will help that person instead. It’s an amazing feeling to be connected with someone from a different place, even the other side of the country, and be able to positively impact their day.

Be brave, and join this community - being another person’s eyes, even just for a moment, can make a real difference.

Seeing Assistant Move,"This app seems to have great potential for my usage cases, but right out of the gate I ran into a blockage. I am photo-phobic and require a complete dark mode UI. The app, like most apps these days, espeically those targetted to the partially sighted, will consider the phone's system setting w.r.t. UI color scheme and adapt accordining. No such luck here. I was unable to find any setting or property to toggle a dark mode UI. I'd be happy to find out I'm just jissing the toggle.",08/17/24 14:37,3,1

Be My Eyes,As a vision impaired person I can’t thank you all enough! Thank you for volunteering your time😊,05/20/22 7:00,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve never written a review, but this one has to go up.

I signed up on the app almost two weeks ago where sighted volunteers can assist visually impaired people across the globe in their day to day activities. 

Funny enough, just last night I was wondering that my phone hasn’t beeped till now and I woke up this morning to my first call where I had to identify the colour of the trousers that a lovely sounding visually impaired lady had to wear today. I was excited for my first call and I honestly didn’t want to mess it up for her. The video quality wasn’t too good and I couldn’t tell blue apart from black, so she promptly held up the trousers against the light to help me identify the right colour. It was navy blue :)

It didn’t take a lot of effort or time and I might not have made a much of a difference, but I haven’t felt this good or even helpful to my ecosystem in a long time.

If you also want to contribute to your ecosystem and help someone else’s life get a tad bit easier, I would highly suggest you download the Be My Eyes App. I for sure can’t wait for my next call!",06/18/18 19:07,2,5

Be My Eyes,So grateful to be a part of this excellent tool to assist people living with low vision/blindness!!!,09/27/22 23:18,1,5
Be My Eyes,"As someone with a vision impairment I have waited all my life for an app like this to come along. I'll be honest before this app came along I held a pesimistic view of people at large because I've experienced trauma and adversity as a child and continuing to this day. So you could imagine how I must have felt to find an app where people are actually quite friendly to you. I don't think I've had an actual bad experience with getting help and if someone couldn't help me they were honest about it. I've a few concerns with this app though. The app runs kind of slowly and it takes a long time to get a volunteer. I'm not sure if it's because of my internet connection or there aren't as many volunteers available. If it's my internet connection well I guess I'll blame it on Comcast, those monopolistic dogs need to go away anyway as they charge way too much for wifi. If it's because there aren't enough volunteers, we should try to market this app so that it works on android so anyone with a smartphone can use it. I'm glad there are more volunteers to blind people. When the ratio of blind people is smaller than the sighted volunteers that means help is more likely to be available, but we should try to make the wait times less. When it comes to specialized help I get help almost instantaniously, but when I try to get help from a volunteer it takes over 3 minutes. Other than that I think the app is fine, let's just try to improve the responsiveness of the app because sometimes my phone lags and freezes. Also it'd be real cool if there was a way to meet potential matches and find love. What better way to look for love than on an app of nice people who actually care enough to help you and understand you as a disabled person. I'd enjoy the idea to find a man to one day be able to say I met my love on an app to help the blind see. These days you can find love in unexpected places.",05/02/19 16:57,3,4
Be My Eyes,This is a fantastic app that I think everyone should have! As a person of sight that has a degenerative eye disease I am grateful every day for being able to see. This app lets me help others who are visually impaired with anything they may need.,07/04/18 14:19,1,5

Be My Eyes,"The app itself is a really great concept, but unfortunately is severely let down by the fact that it is not designed with an accessible user interface! There is no dark mode, and lots of the text is really small and low contrast. Reading white on black is often far easier for visually impaired people such as myself. This app has great potential to be really helpful, but it's clear from the layout of the interface that visually impaired users have not been fully considered during it's design.",10/25/24 3:44,1;3,4
Be My Eyes,"There should be a setting where you can choose time periods throughout the day that you can answer calls. I go to school and I cannot answer calls between 8 and 15.

Be My Eyes,"I'd advise everyone to read the Be My Eyes Terms of Service and Privacy Policies you agree to by using this service, before actually participating in this service.

In their Terms of Service that basically state that may share the content of video calls you do with third parties, and that while anonymizing some details about that, that they will not edit the video calls at all. So, some unknown company you don't know, that Be My Eyes is using to help with their service, will get to view a video conference you made with a blind or sighted person. I don't want anybody besides this company, using that information. TOS agreements like this and just legal bull crap and give the company way too much freedom with your personal data.

I know most people never read a company's Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. But, if you want to know more about what I stated or doubt the veracity of my claim, read it yourself. It is linked at the bottom of the page in the App Store for this app.

Also, something else that I found really detestable in their Terms of Service. Is that Be My Eyes states clearly that they will give your personal information, your phone number, email address, to charities or other similar organizations. Basically, Be My Eyes hands out or more likely sells your personal information to telemarketers. Wow, how wonderful... Just because it's a so called charity you're giving our personal information to, well that doesn't make it less annoying when they hound you on your cell or home phone, day and night, trying to get you to give money. 

Plus, look up online the track record of charities that use telemarketing to get donations. Haha, it's not a very ethical track record. I don't want those possible charlatans constantly annoying me with incessant phone calls all day, every day. They usually don't take ""I'm not interested, please take me off your list, thank you"" for an answer.

I was all for wanting to helping the blind or visually impaired by using this application/service. But, it's a shame that their Terms of Service are so messed up and way too broad for my peace of mind. And, again, I'd advise anyone interested in using this app and service to first read the company's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that you both agree to by using this app/service. 

I give two stars on the merit of this seemingly good idea. But really I would give only the default one star just going off of the shady policies you have to agree to here. Update those to make them less invasive and shady and I'll be happy to help out with by using this app.",05/17/18 7:40,6,2

roughly 85,000 blind users of the app. There was one time that I received a 
call however I was busy with another task at the moment but of course 
someone else was available and picked up the call. The app works how it is 
supposed to so no other complaints there. It's definitely a helpful

Be My Eyes,"I used to help the blind fairly often & really enjoyed doing so...but now there is no way to get the app to open to accept alerts that are defaulting to my Apple Watch.  The call alerts used to be handed off just fine from watch to iPhone on the previous version of Be My Eyes.  I was a ""promising helper"", but no longer can help the blind b/c I can no longer accept calls.  I miss seeing my stats as well.  Why was this taken away?  This was a great idea that no longer works for helpers that have Apple watches.  Many potential helpers excluded now...isn't that defeating your purpose?  Please go back to the old interface, version and functionality that worked just fine.  Another instance of ""Don't fix what is not broken"".  😓",08/05/17 17:12,3,1

You can help in big ways as well as small with this app so please download it whether you’re a volunteer or visually impaired yourself.",08/16/18 22:33,2,5
Be My Eyes,"If you are blind or have low vision and don't have this app, get it now! It means never getting stuck anywhere with nobody around where  the one piece of information is a sign, or something, that you have no way of accessing. It is just amazing that so many people have volunteered to be part of this that you can call on them almost anytime and get someone right away. With the tap of one button. I've used them to read error messages on a new computer when the built-in speech would not start, to look over the manual for a new product, to read the menu in a restaurant which was not on-line, while I was waiting for a friend, and to tell what color a little indicator light was. But I can think of so many places this would have been helpful, and it's really nice knowing I won't get stuck again. Like when the bus isn't coming and there's a print sign about it that I can't read, when an office is closed and there is a sign on the door, when I want to grab a bite to eat and it would normally take me a half hour of poking around  on my phone to figure out what's in the neighborhood, I could just call someone and have *them* look around. And so much more. All the little things that can cause so much trouble just don't have to be a problem.  I particularly appreciate being able to work with volunteers to whom I am anonymous and therefore are doing this for their own reasons, maybe just to contribute to the better good, instead of people who kind of expect an ongoing relationship of gratitude. It is much more dignified. Thanks to all the volunteers who do give their time this way.",03/03/19 18:02,2,5

When I take pictures to post on Instagram, I use TapTapSee to make sure I captured what I wanted to. I do the same thing when someone goofs up and sends me a picture. I've also used it to identify drinks, medicines and my clothes. It's also fun to take random pictures of objects in my house and see what it comes up with.

Be My Eyes,"i think this app is great for those who have vision problems and are hearing. however what about deaf people who also have low vision? i think it would be great if there was a way that they could be on this app and be connected to volunteers like me who also know sign language so that they too can get the help they need with tasks such as these. there are several medical conditions that cause both low vision and hearing loss. i don’t think it would take much of a change to the app for this but I’m not an app developer so i don’t know. i have a friend who texts me all the time asking to read phone numbers and such that are too small and I’ve wanted to suggest this app, but while he can speak, he lost his hearing in high school and now relies on sign language for receptive communication. so he continues to rely on friends like me but sometimes i don’t see the text right away. so that’s my take. it’s great but leaves out a large group of low-vision people that could use our help too.",09/01/23 11:20,2;3,4

I want to be wrong about this but it’s impossible for me to get through all the instructions since I can’t read them. Voice over would take forever to get through the instructions, too.

The simplicity of the app makes it easy to use, and the sense of community it fosters is heartwarming. Five stars all the way!",02/15/24 14:24,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Unsafe. I absolutely love the idea of this app but it's being so massively misused, I have finally uninstalled it. I have been getting calls from really shady looking men who are clearly not blind, groups of children having fun. How are users being verified? I would be too scared to use this one, I am not even sure if they were able to see me or not.",12/11/22 2:53,6,2
Be My Eyes,"Use your eyes for good. Did you know that kindness costs absolutely nothing?

I truly believe everyone should download Be My Eyes. This incredible, free app allows people with sight to assist those who are blind or visually impaired in their everyday lives—helping them identify objects, read labels, or navigate the world with a little extra confidence.

As a volunteer, I’ve had the privilege of answering calls from people who just need a quick pair of eyes—whether it’s choosing the right product at home, reading expiration dates at the store, or simply confirming colors. Each call is just a few minutes, yet the impact lasts so much longer.

Since joining on April 24, I’ve received four calls so far. While I do my best to answer every time, I know that if I can’t pick up, another amazing volunteer will. It’s a beautiful reminder of how small acts of kindness can create a ripple effect of support and connection.

I can only imagine how valuable this app is for those who rely on it, but I know how rewarding it feels to be able to help. Huge applause to the creators of Be My Eyes—this app is changing lives, one call at a time.

Most calls take less than five minutes. That’s all it takes to make someone’s day a little easier. So why not use your eyes to help someone see? 

Download Be My Eyes today—you never know whose life you might brighten.",02/10/25 18:40,2,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such an amazing tool for both parties involved. I have blind family members and the independence they feel with the accessibility of this app is something they never thought they would feel and that is beautiful. As a volunteer this app is wonderfully designed to aid those who are blind in a simple and effective manner. The set up is very easy to understand and your ability to connect so easily without any issues is honestly amazing. I would highly recommend to anybody! Whether blind, low vision, or just somebody with a heart to help. Two thumbs up from me!",06/05/19 16:57,1,5

I got one the next day!!!! I was crying when I hung up because after helping a vision impaired lady with medication, she said she had to put her dog down. I wished her the best given her situation.

Be My Eyes,"This app is a really great idea and I don’t doubt at all that its helped a lot of people. Probably needs more promotion in blind spaces since theres not many visually impaired people on it, but still helpful to those who are. Unfortunately there seems to be a lot of creeps on it. The one call I’ve gotten was a man who could very obviously see fine and was just being a pervert. Sorting reviews by most critical shows this is not a rare experience either.",12/08/24 3:25,1;6,3

Well, with this app, it's possible! I can't tell you how many times I wanted to know what kind of candy is on a shelf at a store, but I just haven't been able to figure it out! With this app, you can. I wish there was seriously a 10 star rating, because I would totally give this app a 10 star rating. I mean come on, they make you pay 4 bucks on up  a month? That's less than they should make you pay for it, for all the things that it does!  People want to complain that you need to  pay for the app? It's stupid! I mean, come on! These wonderful people put so much time into this app, if people want to complain just because they have to subscribe to the app, and they have to pay a lousy $4 or up!  That's nothing! I just love this app so much, that I couldn't bear just pay $10, and have to pay $10 again after the end of the month. So, I did the next best thing! I paid for three months. Because, I get so much use out of this app, I felt like paying for three months, and getting Not only  my moneys worth, but my pictures worth, Since they are unlimited pictures!  TapTapSee, you guys are the best, as far as describing pictures, and making the results come fast! I can't give you guys enough gratitude!

Most free or minimal cost apps don't have consistent OCR identification accuracy, however this app puts most if not all which fall in the afore mentioned category to shame.

Great job Microsoft, I look forward to seeing new revisions of the software in the future.",07/15/17 14:48,1;4,5

But I am still thinking how this app works because a blind person anyways requires someone's help to pick up a phone, go to an app and call someone so what's the point in calling someone else when there is already some helper available.

Seeing AI,I recently became blind. Your application has allowed me to be able to read my mail and read products that I have at home on my shelves and  allowed me to pay the taxi driver using your money identifier without fear of being ripped off. I would like to see the barcode scanner improved with more product availability. A lot of times it just says no description available.

Be My Eyes,"One suggestion I have would be the ability to leave a short message at the 
conclusion of a call. My first call ended abruptly when I momentarily lost 
my network connection. I would have liked the opportunity to apologize to 
my partner on the other end! Also, my mother has used this app as a blind 
person, and would like to send a note of thanks to those who help her.",06/05/18 13:12,3,5
Be My Eyes,"The idea is amazing. However changes need to be made so it doesn't become just another forgotten app. I have been a member for over a month and nothing, so either blind people aren't using it or the filter are not well planned out. There should be a way of putting more than one language which would help increasing chances of getting calls for those who speak more than one language. I strongly believe in the whole idea for this app but changes and maybe a better publicity for it in the blind community should be made so that it can truly bring a great experience to all it's users",12/09/18 5:12,1;4,4

First off I'm blind in one eye and can't barely see our of the other. So far something that the app has gotten right but if you don't want something to happen you need this app to really have it diff between a wall and the floor and mirror and steps.

Be My Eyes,"I love being able to help someone day or night 24/7. There is many people who are willing to answer the call whenever you need help. I just have one wish that the assistant could have settings where we can make our calls louder and call whenever we want not just where we live, instead of the original of what comes with the app. I am half deaf so I can barely hear when someone calls, but I have my volume up the highest it can go, and I have my settings on the loudest it can do on my part on my phone. I wish the app would fix or put in settings where you can choose a louder sound for calls. I would love to help more people if the app can put better features that can happen so I can get to my phone faster. Lol I just love helping people!

BlindSquare,"I have had this app a few years and I use it exclusively for bus travel. Don’t need it for trains, only if the stop announcement automation is not working then I will employ blind Square. It is fantastic on buses because it opens up an  horizon of information I’ve never had access to before. Even on very Familia roots. It gives you everything from pubs, restaurants to businesses. It reads out every junction which it  never  did before which is very helpful when judging my bus stop distance However, I hear references to searching bus stops as a landmark and I don’t know how to do that. Any help would be appreciated. i’ve never used it for walking a route maybe I will try that.

Be My Eyes,"I never was called to help a blind person. What I did get is an endless supply of junk mail in my inbox, they must have sold my email address because I never give it out....I thought this was a worthy cause.  I feel I got scammed.",07/09/16 10:47,3,1
Be My Eyes,Whoever thought of this app is an absolute genius! I love the fact that i can help a visually impaired person whenever they need it right from home or wherever i am. This is amazing and extremely humbling!,02/22/19 1:27,1,5
Be My Eyes,I love helping everyone whose calls I’m able to answer. It really helps those who are vision impaired❤️,09/08/20 21:21,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve had the pleasure of answering several calls out through this app, and it always makes me happy to know that I was able to help another person! I was a bit worried at first if there was going to be people taking advantage of the video call feature to show inappropriate imagery, but Be My Eyes does a absolutely phenomenal job in making sure that doesn’t happen. I’ve only had pleasant experiences when answering calls, and would recommend this app to volunteers as well as those who have difficulty with vision.",10/19/23 22:28,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"Be My Eyes has helped me a lot, especially the new feature called Be My AI. Through that feature, I am able to read the image description on my phone independently, and put an alt text on my social media posts for my fellow blind friends without asking for sighted assistance. But I can't install it on my new tablet.",03/15/24 22:33,1;2;3,5

Be My Eyes,"I'd give a 5,as I think it's a great idea (I work for a charity that helps VI people), but this morning I was woken up by a call.. It'd be nice to have a setting to say when you are sleeping or busy & not able to help",10/07/17 14:31,3;4,4
Be My Eyes,What a brilliant idea and something so easy for the visually impaired!,04/26/23 16:21,1,5
Be My Eyes,How does a blind person know to get this app? How does a blind person know what to push?,01/16/15 23:22,-1,1
Be My Eyes,I think this application is awesome and all blind people should use it because it is very helpful since blind people can't get married to people that are that aren't visually impaired and choose not to help special needs people,11/10/17 14:04,1,5
Seeing Eye GPS,"Highly disappointed  I did not mind the cost but expected a lot more from Sendero.  I completed several POI why searches for businesses close to my house and got no results.  This was done using each of the route options for GPS.  I completed a POI search for a specific grocery store close to my house and the directions were inaccurate. It stated the business was on the right when in actuality it was on the left.  If nothing else at least make it accurate.  Also, when completing  a POI  while search it is very slow compared to other applications such as MapQuest. For a totally blind user the app was very easy to navigate. At this point I will continue to use MapQuest And would not recommend this app until the accuracy is fixed.
 
For those that are complaining about the cost look at the cost of the previous mapping programs from Sonero And the cost of the device to run them.",07/13/13 5:37,3,1

Be My Eyes,"1st . As a volunteer  I can’t set my availability time and like today I did receive a call but I was at work and didn’t have a chance to answer and now just thinking about is that person found someone to get help ?
2nd . As a volunteer, I hope we can have an score board and a donation part for help projects whom working for helping blind people to we can show others and explain them how it’s work and how we did well and if they want can be a volunteer or do the donation for helping others",07/17/18 17:56,3;4,5
TapTapSee,This is a revolutionary app for the iPhone for blind and visually impaired. I'm amazed at how fast it is at identifying objects. This will be useful just about anywhere!,01/26/13 14:10,1,5
Be My Eyes,I enjoy it soo much and I think it is very helpful to the visually impaired however I don’t get calls very often at all so it is something that seems to be slightly inactive. But other than that it is a great app and I love reading people’s stories and of course helping others.,08/13/19 6:37,1,4
Be My Eyes,I was really happy to help a blind,04/01/23 8:03,1,5
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,I'm a sighted person who has been trying this app out because I'm helping a lady who has recently become blind. In general it seems excellent but it can seemingly forget the tracked destination sometimes; this has happened when on a bus journey of several miles I've set it to track the destination bus stop - after a few miles it stops giving updates on the distance to the tracked destination.,09/21/21 11:50,1;2;3,4
Be My Eyes,The app works really well and is a good way to help people. I've only ever gotten one call but that's very understandable as according to the count in the app there are 3 million volunteers and only around two hundred thousand blind people using it so it makes sense that calls would be rare,06/14/20 17:00,1,5
Seeing AI,"I truly love this iPhone application As someone who is completely blind. I have only one thing that could make this app better. Please add a PDF conversion channel. I cannot even say how many times I receive digital documents from professors and others in my college experience. This is just something that is essential for me personally, but if it was able to be added to the app that would be great.",11/07/18 5:22,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,"It's an undoubtedly a wondrous initiative to help the blind people. My personal experience has been very good- I was able to answer few calls and help the needy blind people in solving their minor problems such as the text/captcha code reading, identify some documentation, etc. I really liked the app and strongly encourage others to use it to ease the lives of blind people.",01/05/22 2:27,1,5
RightHear - Blind Assistant,A much needed aid for the visually impaired,02/08/17 5:12,2,5
Be My Eyes,"I work in a doctor’s office and learned about BME through a patient telling me she sometimes has to use the app to tell which prescription is which when her usual pharmacy that offers braille labels isn’t available to fill a script. Everyone on our staff immediately downloaded the app, and anytime we get a notification to accept!  I’ve only gotten to help just a single person so far, but as a volunteer, this app really gives us a sense of what it means to be human, to give back to humanity, unselfishly. If more of us gave so freely of just a few minutes of our time each month, collectively, think of what else we could accomplish!
Don’t download the app to make yourself feel better. That’s a selfish reason. But if that just happens to be a consequence of wanting to help others, then that’s what humanity is about!",07/25/18 17:45,2,5
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded the app a few months ago. I got my first call a few weeks ago helping a woman read her insurance card while she was sitting at a diner eating breakfast! How cool is that? A simple iPhone app just changed the game for the visually impaired. Whoever thought this up, good job!",08/18/17 13:39,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"I noticed the app in the App Store and decided to download. This was nearly two weeks ago as I guess I was a little skeptical to use it. This past Sunday as I was getting ready to go to lunch, I pulled out a chain that I wanted to put a gold pendant on.  Now...is the chain silver or gold?  I asked myself as if I knew. So, I figured this may be a good time to try Be My Eyes...After creating my account I was connected with a very kind young lady who was able to tell me the chain was gold!  What a huge help to this blind lady who loves her jewelry and clothes! Thank you Be My Eyes and thank you to the awesome volunteers who truly can make a difference in peoples lives.  The only downside is I really wish Be My Eyes had been around before I lost my sight because I would have loved to have been a volunteer!!",04/03/19 1:21,2,5
Be My Eyes,"Simple idea but utter genius! You get an alert, shown a video link to a blind or visually impaired person. You see what they can't and talk to them. Could be which is an item of clothing or expiry date or product ingredients. Easy, simple way to make a small but significant difference to a blind person.",12/28/19 17:46,1;2,5

Has small buttons so it can save space for the on screen image - For Blind people!!!! 
Worst of all it cannot recognise actual things such as tomatoes.",05/21/23 2:09,3,1
Be My Eyes,"Love this app, have had it for years now and it's sometimes pretty rare to get a call. I've helped a lady that was visually impaired who herself helped others. They girl she was with was hesitant about using this app so we just talked a little about calls I've helped others on and explained to her that no request would be to small for her to use this. Helped another gentleman bake a cake even lol. Have recommended to all of my friends and family.",02/01/22 7:25,1;2,5
TapTapSee,Awesome app if you're blind. Either snap a picture when you hear the focus beep or choose one from your library and the app will tell you what it is. Must have app for the visually impaired.,07/05/13 17:01,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,I love this app! I have two sight impaired sisters and this is a wonderful tool for people to use!,09/20/18 0:31,1,5

Envision AI,very good application easy to use help two blind people,02/26/19 9:33,1,5
Seeing AI,"Overall, I have found this app very useful and accomplishing day-to-day tasks such as identifying canned goods or sorting the mail. However, it is very inconsistent ( and unacceptably so) in its ability to read the output of digital displays. FYI, I am speaking throughout this review of the short text channel. I use this app every day to read my kitchen scale for making coffee and for other reasons. At times, it reads the output quickly and accurately. At other times, it takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to read the display. Words are inadequate to describe the frustration I feel when a 30-second task turns into a 10-minute one, draining my phone battery all the while. If a pair of human eyeballs can read the display, then there should be no reason why Seeing AI cannot also read it. This problem seems particularly exacerbated by readings that end in either 1 or 7 (such as 21 G). The app has no problem reading the labels of the buttons on the scale, but it all too often fails to read literally the only thing on the display I want to hear. Perhaps a new channel could be created in the app that is optimized specifically for the reading of displays. Please work on this! In a world in which many home appliances are still inaccessible, it is more important than ever that blind people have access to an app like Seeing AI that is capable of reading a display. My rating reflects the frustration caused by the app's seeming inability to accomplish one of its core functions in situations that I need it most. I commit to updating my rating when this issue is addressed.",04/26/24 18:08,1;2;3,2
Be My Eyes,"I'm blind, and I haven't used this very often, but when I do, it's a lifesaver. A few years ago, when I was really in need of a drink, someone help me with figuring out what button on the soda machine to press. Today I tried it out again, when I received my new Wi-Fi router, and a really nice lady help me get it working.",10/05/16 16:46,1;2,5
Seeing AI,"I am not blind, but I always love to see new technology. This app is, for lack of a better word, amazing. It can recognize people once you enter their face into its memory. It reads barcodes and tells you what the product is, and it can read written or printed text. And it's free! Thanks MS for making a great product.",09/20/17 5:11,1,5
Be My Eyes,Not sure why but I have received only one call and it was prankster pretending to be blind. They started swearing and verbally abusing me while I was with my children. No way to report them either. Disappointed that people are using this as a joke and taking away from people who actually need help. I'll keep the app for now but the next time it happens I'm removing it. There should be a way to report these jerks.,11/21/21 9:56,6,1

Be My Eyes,"The concept is simple and it’s been effectively implemented as far as I can tell from using it so far. I also find the community stories that are shared inspiring and useful. Often they help me to see what I am either blind or only partially able to see, namely my own implicit assumptions about what it’s like to be visually impaired. It helps me also to glimpse what incredible untapped potential we all have within us. In being of help I find I am being helped and that’s a real blessing. Thank you.",11/24/20 3:03,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I understand that there is a lot of helpers compared to blind people that isn’t necessarily there fault but I don’t like it because I didn’t sign up to have an app sit on my phone and never go to use.

Be My Eyes,Ha!! how could a blind use a cellphone?,12/15/17 6:23,-1,1
Be My Eyes,The app seems to be focusing too much on collecting the volunteers email and getting permission to send spam. You can't start anything without giving a real email (already a red flag). And the home screen is designed to eventually get your consent to send spam. There is no simple opt out. That doesn't seem like the purpose of the app is helping blind people. It's collecting your data.,04/24/20 11:41,6,1
Be My Eyes,I love the concept and I’ve been able to get many calls in my tenure of 6+ years now. It’s a blessing to help others. I’m blind in one eye myself so I get to share what I have left and it’s a gift and a privilege.,09/12/24 12:30,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I'm sad to see all the 1 star reviews just because people haven't gotten a request for help yet. I haven't either, but the app seems to be a great start to assisting people that ask for help. The set-up and functions are easy to follow, great that it runs in the background, nice that there is a point reward system. Heard the system functioning perfectly through a segment on Hawaii NPR - had a blind woman ask for help, one woman she connected with was in Australia and the other was in Thailand.

I said no.. then I saw a button that turn on the flash light of caller mobile. I clicked it. In the light I saw a hand holding an Identity card. The caller asked me can you tell me what is the date of printing of this card ...I read whatever I saw in the Identity card then I request him to show the backside of the card ...there it was the date of printing. I told him it was printed today only. He thanked me...I asked him from where you are he responded Delhi........the whole conversation was in Hindi.I felt great by helping a Blind person....you can do this help too.. just few minutes of your time can help a blind person manage small task which is difficult to do without eyes....... कुछ मिनट पहले मेरे मोबाइल पर एक कॉल आया। जब मैंने कॉल उठाया तो मैंने एक पिच डार्क स्क्रीन देखी और एक आवाज आई ""सर, आपको कुछ दिख रहा है?"" मैंने कहा नहीं.. फिर मैंने एक बटन देखा जो कॉलर मोबाइल की फ्लैश लाइट चालू करता है। मैंने इसे क्लिक किया। रोशनी में मैंने एक हाथ में पहचान पत्र पकड़े देखा। फोन करने वाले ने मुझसे पूछा कि क्या आप मुझे बता सकते हैं कि इस कार्ड की छपाई की तारीख क्या है ... मैंने पहचान पत्र में जो कुछ भी देखा, मैंने उससे कार्ड का पिछला भाग दिखाने का अनुरोध किया ... वहां छपाई की तारीख थी . मैंने उससे कहा कि यह आज ही छपा है। उसने मुझे धन्यवाद दिया...मैंने उससे पूछा कि तुम कहाँ से हो उसने जवाब दिया दिल्ली.......पूरी बातचीत हिंदी में थी।मुझे एक अंधे व्यक्ति की मदद करके बहुत अच्छा लगा....आप भी यह मदद कर सकते हैं। आपके समय के कुछ ही मिनट नेत्रहीन व्यक्ति को छोटे से छोटे कार्य को संभालने में मदद कर सकते हैं जो बिना आंखों के करना मुश्किल है .......",03/07/22 5:32,2,5

Be My Eyes,"What a wonderful app! I'm a volunteer, and it's so good to see that the number of volunteers VS the number of blind users is so much higher - proof that there is good in this world. It's super easy to use, you answer the video call and the video chat starts. Since there are so many volunteers, you won't answer that many calls, so every now and then, make sure you're still logged in.",02/02/23 17:36,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I think this is a great app in general. I was a little bummed out when I learned that because there are significantly more volunteers than there are blind people on the app, you don’t get a call very often. I’ve had this for Over a year and I’ve only ever gotten five calls, and only one of which I was able to answer in time. The others I actually missed because the alert sound was so quiet and I couldn’t hear it. It does have a unique ring that doesn’t sound like any of your other alert sounds, but it’s very hard to hear if you’re not sitting in a totally quiet room. If the calls had been louder, I probably would have been able to answer them in time. Also, if you miss a call, it does not leave you an alert saying that you missed one. You have to see it ring to even know you missed an alert.There is also no history log of how many calls you’ve received or how many people you’ve helped… Which is fine but it would be nice to be able to go and look back and see how many calls you’ve missed and taken and how many people you’ve helped, etc. 
I was really disappointed when I missed my second call because I really enjoyed answering the very first call I ever got. I certainly don’t wish that there were more blind people that need help, and it’s great that so many people want to volunteer to help, but I just wish I had more opportunities to use this app more than once a year. That is a selfish point of view though, because this is otherwise a really great tool. I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys helping other people.",10/05/21 19:13,1;3,5

Seeing AI,"the updates keep getting better, from the jumping text, they fixed it, to the document channel being sluggish and now that's fixed. microsoft is doing an excellent job and no account needed and this all free. love it. my one thing is I would love the seen preview and where you share photos from the share sheet to have a way to interact with the AI like you can now in the document channel. these guys brought much more rich descriptions to the seen and share sheets, but theres no interactions with it, if you could ask it followup you would have a 5 star app I think. edit, you can now ask seeingAI questions about your photo, this is fantastic.   I have no problem recommending this app and the other thing i'll say is working with microsoft's seeingAI staff via email you get quick responces. I do not work with them but what I mean is like emailing them, their turnaround time has ben rather snappy I feel. they seem to really get blind people with their seeingAI here and its just getting better.edit, as of Version 5.5, the interface is much more streamlined, I didn't think it possible to make it any easier but they did, and they blended a few channels into one, like the read tab is short text and document all in one and you also have the option to toggle with a button with document alignment and you can even take a photo in that tab. theres so much more they did and its just excellent and we still get access to the older stuff. I love the describe tab updates, now you get a rich description right out of the gate when you snap a photo or load one. its excellent thank you so much Microsoft and team over at seeing AI.",02/08/25 16:05,1,5

Be My Eyes,I'm giving only four stars because it's a very good concept but it takes a little while for anyone to get a call and help someone so they think that this app is just going to be a waste of space so maybe you could try to get on local news to see if anyone that doesn't know about this app specially blind people know about it so we can get more calls and like people can feel better about themselves,04/14/21 20:06,1;3,4
Be My Eyes,"I just had another amazing opportunity to help a visually impaired person virtually - through the “Be My Eyes” app.  

I helped him determine if a frozen rice pack he bought was microwaveable, how to unpackage it, and how to cook it.

Be My Eyes,"3/5 Stars While the idea is great the user interface and features aren’t the best.
-First, Once I created my account I wasn’t even sure if the app worked. Does the app have to be open to receive a call or does it run in the background. I was under the impression that I want running in the background because the little triangle in the upper right hand, the one that tells you an app was recently using your location, was not present. So that one problem that I saw with the app, I wasn’t sure if the app was working properly. 
-Second, there seems to be a lot of “trolls” on the internet and Im concerned that they could be misguiding the blind by giving them wrong information. I think there needs to be a way to separate those who genuinely help and those who are trying to pull a prank, I think there should be a rating system of some sort where users can have a rating or something so the “most helpful” stand out. 
-Third, is there  a way of turning the service off? I would love for the app to be running in the background so I may be of assistance to the blind in need but I think there should be a way to pause or temporarily shut off the service, like at night when your trying to get sleep. But over all, great idea and concept, just some issues that I’m sure will be fixed in future updates.",01/22/15 0:49,3,3

Seeing AI,"Very good at doing so many things and a fun way to play around with image detection AI!  Barcode reader is the best one I've ever used. Face detection seems extremely well implemented, I was able to quickly take a nicely framed up selfie using the back camera and the audio cues from the app. It tells you the subject's gender, age, and mood.  And then there's the scene detection where you take a picture and it does its best to describe what it sees. It's not always accurate but it's usually pretty close, and sometimes it can come up with some interesting feedback. 

Everything feels VERY snappy, at least on my iPhone 7 Plus on my home WiFi. The voice is so responsive and quick that using the app feels almost futuristic at times. This is the main thing that differentiates this from things I've seen before. It feels a bit like an Apple product— none of these AI technologies is new, but it's the first time they are all together in one accessible place and so well executed. 

The only thing that didn't work for me was the document detection feature, I tried many times to scan a receipt on A4 paper from an online purchase and it appeared to recognize the geometry of the paper very well and quickly asked me to hold still but then said there wasn't any text found while displaying a black screen where there would normally be an image. Apparently a minor bug which I hope they'll hammer out in the next release. 

I truly believe this app will help many people with vision impairment. Thank you for your hard work on making something great!",07/13/17 10:21,1,5

Be My Eyes,I REALLY love the idea of helping blind or low sighted people all over the world with just a call. Right now its over 2 million volunteers and about 100 thousand low sighted/blind people that could call you and it only takes about 1-5 minutes helping them out. Mostly you get asked simple questions like what color a shirt has for example. It always makes me feel happier after helping a person and maybe even making their day a little better. (Everyone I met so far was really sweet and polite.),10/17/19 18:09,1;2,5

Seeing AI,"I installed this app the day I first heard of it, while listening to the ACB national convention nearly two years ago.  Even though I had had KNFB Reader for a number of years, I mainly added this one for comparison, but soon discovered that it compares favorably with the aforementioned app, as well as with other light-detecting, color-identifying and currency-reading apps I have used over the last five years. I soon realized that I needed to get a newer iPhone in order to use the Products feature—which I did.  I use the app just about every day, for everything from reading mail to reading books, some magazines, and cooking instructions on that packaged dinner I just pulled out of the freezer, and even making sure that coupon I plan to use at a local business hasn’t expired.  The Short Text works especially well, for those times you don’t wish to scan an entire document.  For most things, the Document channel works well, and I like it that the focusing is done automatically.  However, there are occasions when I get the “No text recognized” alert; so then, I revert to KNFB Reader, and sometimes it does a better job reading that document.  I am totally blind from birth; so I am assuming that the documents for which I get that alert are those printed in multiple colors, and with numerous graphics that land smack in the middle of the written text.  I can’t vouch for the color identifier channel—as I have never been able to see color; but, knowing that lighting can affect the way color is perceived—even by a good set of eyes—my take is that any attempt at a color identifier is better than none at all.  The currency reader has improved markedly since the app first came out.  I have been able to read a number of handwritten greeting cards—and other items as well—with the Handwriting channel.  The light detector has saved me any amount of grief, since I have a number of light switches (for overhead lights, of course), which are push-buttons rather than up-and-down toggles; and, we all know people who can’t remember to turn the lights off when they leave.  I’ve had considerable fun with the Scene channel, which is often quite accurate.  I have occasionally had a bit of difficulty getting the bar-code reader (Product channel) to work; but then, bar codes aren’t always in the same location on a box or container.  Just today, I had to search diligently for the bar code on a frozen meal, in order to then read the cooking instructions.  By the time I found and read that information, my battery status had dropped precipitously, from 85 to 60 percent!  If one is using the app for any length of time at a stretch, I suggest that they either have their phone plugged in, or have an external battery handy, as it is a major drain.  On the other hand, this afternoon I was able to read an online menu—which was otherwise totally inaccessible because it was an _image— from a local restaurant.  In this case, SeeingAI did a better job reading it than KNFB Reader!  Finally, to those who insist that there is no currency reader channel, could it be that they are still on an iPhone 5S or earlier?  And to those who insist that the app doesn’t work well with VoiceOver, perhaps they are just new to VoiceOver and need help with it?  This has really been a life-changing app!  I look forward to even more improvements and enhancements, and apologize for the length of this review.",05/26/19 16:28,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"I love this idea!
Some visually impaired people can access writing and particularly for  people who are also HoH/D/deaf some may prefer a written response.  
I signed up to help but expected it to be photos and comments/written descriptions and maybe audio recordings.  I’m HoH and too anxious for audio calls.  I just wondered if having non video call responses might be preferable for quite a lot of potential users.

Volunteer service is superb! The developers are very creative to come upon 
app like these. Seriously Really need to appreciate this app.",07/14/18 6:06,1,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,Finally - a free app for the blind that helps us live more independently. While I appreciate the different modes the currency option should inform you which side of the bill is showing and whether it's right side up or upside down. Keep in mind a lot of users have no vision so we need to know these things.,05/26/24 17:38,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,A perfect way to connect the visually impaired with a volunteer who can help. It's simply awesome!,06/14/19 18:24,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Great concept but too many bugs, got disconnected from a call trying to come through. Can't imagine how frustrating it must get for that to happen to the visually impaired trying to use this.",08/01/22 5:33,5,2
Be My Eyes,"This is an AMAZING opportunity to volunteer wherever you are! It's a simple video call from a blind person who needs a little help from a sighted person. I think everyone should have this APP. Why not help someone? Volunteering always makes me feel amazing, but THIS...the feeling is incredible.  It's a way to make a difference; sure it may be in a small way...at least it may seem small to you...until you hear the gratitude in there voice when they say thanks/thank you for your help/and the list goes on.  The climate in the US related to political things has this country the most divided in my lifetime; so WHY NOT take a moment to help someone...you never know how big or small, sorry for the rant ppl I am just passionate about focusing on good and positive things. So, get off social media once and while and use this app. It takes so little space. I hope this app keeps growing and surpasses every goal the developer/creators had. Currently there are approximately 60 thousand non-sighted/impaired sighted individuals on this app and approximately 800 thousand sighted ppl. I hope it continues to evolve to help ppl even more people and in more ways. An unsolicited plug for this app, to stop what you're doing and download it. And ppl out there, PLEASE volunteer in your community as well!  Hats off to the creators and developers of this app! The world needs more positivity and ways to help fellow man.",01/06/18 18:03,2,5
Be My Eyes,"This is a great app especially when I go away for work and I'm staying in hotels. It's wonderful to just be able to connect to be my eyes and get someone to help me find the apple juice or help me change the air conditioner or heater in the room. It's nice to be able to do things without always having to ask someone else for help or find someone to ask for help. I really appreciate it and it's great to show clients as well. I am a vision rehabilitation therapist and I show this app to clients all the time. The volunteers are very patient and very nice. I really appreciate their effort and time.
My only complaint would be that it takes a lot of time at times to connect to a volunteer. If this issue could be fixed this would be even better.",06/09/15 21:06,1;2,4

I recently helped a blind guy that told me that there are days when there is nobody available to help. I find this odd as I am almost always available but have only been contacted a few times. 

There should also be a trusted helper list where the most helpful people are placed ahead of newbies.",07/16/15 23:24,3,3
Seeing AI,"This app makes my life much easier. While not being totally blind but with about 5% vision I can still see the little icons in the bottom. Haven’t used everything yet but the short text, document reader, currency, and color has come in very handy. You know you don’t want to look silly and where mismatch clothes lol.

So I just use the product tab and figured out there was another icon that it would read me more information. The short text doesn’t always read the instructions well for heating but the extra product info gave me all the information I needed. This app matched with my Alexa microwave/oven/air fryer is going to be absolutely marvelous together. Thank you for this app and thank you for continuing to update it.",10/14/21 13:28,2,5

Be My Eyes,I'm not blind but I want to support this good idea,03/20/20 12:50,1,5
Be My Eyes,This is a simple way to help people in need. The app is easy to use. I’ve been a volunteer for two to three years. I shared this app with everyone from my company (about 80 employees) so they can share the same experience as me. I have had minimal conversations after assisting the blind and it has been a pleasure to get to know people from around the country. I highly recommend it.,07/04/23 11:40,1,5
Be My Eyes,It will help blind people,05/26/20 8:50,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such an amazing app, I’m glad I found it when I did. Being able to help someone who really needs it and spread kindness brings joy to them and yourself. My grandmother was visually impaired and I would help with a lot of day to day tasks, so being able to help others brings nostalgia. It doesn’t take much out of your day to help others, this is an app that I believe everyone should have.",11/04/23 16:20,1,5

Seeing AI,I recently became blind. Your application has allowed me to be able to read my mail and read products that I have at home on my shelves and  allowed me to pay the taxi driver using your money identifier without fear of being ripped off. I would like to see the barcode scanner improved with more product availability. A lot of times it just says no description available. I would love to see this app available on the Mac so that I can scan my mail using my scanner. Just a thought :-),06/24/21 5:59,2;4,5
Be My Eyes,I just want to say that it's beautiful that an app like this exists to help other blind people.,12/08/21 2:59,1,5

Supersense - AI for Blind,"A good app and it’s priced for $49. It does a lot of the things that it’s competition does but in some aspects it does them better. I found the barcode section of the app very usable especially in grocery stores. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app once but it seems to be working like a charm. The app is quick fast and intuitive I have run it on an iPhone XS max as well as an iPhone 12 pro. Maybe as the developer said the state will reimburse me for the price of the app. I could not get myself to pull the trigger for $99, it was just too much money but because of the holiday sale I purchased it for $49. We will see if the price is worth it if the developers keep iterating on the app with new improvements. I know they’re free apps out there that do the same but I’m from the old-school, you get what you pay for. The best feature that this app or anyone can come out with is that the app would be able to read a touchscreen display such as on a laundry machine or vending machine, that’s the function everybody wants. I think a company that can make it happened will excite the entire visually impaired community.",12/31/20 11:28,2,4

Be My Eyes,"I have been a member about 6 months. I was the first to answer a call for the first time about a month ago. That gentleman was new to the app and just wanted to try it out and ask some questions. Today I received a call where a woman had three pairs of tights, and needed to know which were blue, brown, and black. It was easy to help her and she seemed very grateful. 

As someone with RP but who still has very functional vision, it is so rewarding to be able to offer assistance. I have seen negative reviews from others that were frustrated they rarely got calls, and were never the first to answer. It was five months before I was actually able to help someone, so just stick with it. I think it is also helpful to remember this isn't about you, it's about the person that needs assistance. Basically you have nothing to lose by being a member, and eventually will be able to assist someone. I am glad there are services like this out there for me when I need help someday.",10/21/17 17:45,1,5

Lookout - Assisted vision,Lookout - Assisted vision This app is good. You have to fix some problem. 1. Most of the time we don't need the camera light. on or off we can adjust the light then it will be best to use 2. You should give us the option to choose which camera. we are using and we can fix the zoom quality and lock the zoom quality that will be best we users will be more efficiently we can use,03/16/25 9:47,3,4
WeWALK - Smart Map,"I’m a low vision user so I have been trying to use the app using there visualisation option To make fonts larger. 

When I do this the fonts get larger but they write over themselves so cannot be actually read. So you can’t use there actual large print! You have to put it on smaller size. 

I thought it might be dynamic fonts interfering so I turned them off for the app and nope it’s just that poorly made. 

Whilst elements of it are useful I wish there was a better way to search for locations. It’s hard to plan a route to the location if it’s not listed.",03/28/25 7:18,3,3

I grew up helping my grandmother the way the visually impaired need help through this app.  I wish this was around when my grandmother was alive.  It makes me feel good to know I can be the eyes for those who live in darkness or cannot see well enough to do even simply tasks.  Sometimes I feel overwhelmed with emotion when I help someone through this app.  This makes me sad but also so happy that I can help others, and so easily.  I don’t even need to leave my home.  I hope the creators are able to get the word out to more visually impaired people so I can get more calls.",12/21/21 3:04,1,5

OneStep Reader,"I have performed several scans that included different types of materials and conditions. I will tell you that no other app I have used even comes close to producing the results of the knfbReader app. I have used Prizmo, which is the only other app that comes close. Yes, the knfbReader app was designed with the visually impaired or blind person in mind and that despite what some will say is its strength. I do not believe this app costs $99.99 just to overcharge a certain segment of the population, the “blind tax,” but instead is a high-quality app that delivers on the features and performance promised. I could say quite a lot, but it really comes down to one thing and that is for you to decide if you want to work hard or work smart. Yes, you can pay less for apps that will do the job, but these other apps require a lot more fiddling to find the best position for extracting enough legible text to figure out what you got. People have used stands of all types to get the job done. With the knfbReader app you do not really need any stands etc. If you have one it will certainly help and especially when doing batches of image captures using the automatic mode. Otherwise, you can simply hold your device about eight to 10 inches above the material and nearly instantaneously get your results. I have absolutely no regrets paying $99.99 for an app that meets a need and I can remove all other apps. BTW, when I figure the cost of apps and a couple of stands I have purchased in trying to find a good solution I probably spent more than the cost of the knfbReader app. :)",09/19/14 19:17,1,5

Be My Eyes,"I want to love this app; as a wheelchaired person myself, I wanted to help. But I have legal training and I have read a lot of Terms of Service—this one is using the need of its users (and probably hoping few people will actually read the TOS) to exploit the blind and low-sighted since they have their backs to the wall. The company retains full control of all content with the option to publish it as an ad, and your data will persist even if you delete your account. There’s vague wording about having your account terminated if you change the appearance of the app or website, but since they have full rights to interpret the TOS, that can include visual aids. There’s a lot more but you get the idea. I’m dismayed and disappointed that a blind person would do this to his fellow blind persons.",01/24/20 14:03,6,2
Be My Eyes,"Absolutely fantastic idea and execution to help visually impaired folks. Take the time and donate a few minutes to answer a call for someone trying to figure something out. Whether it be sorting canned food, logging into their computer, asking which milk is expired, use your power of vision to help those in need. Every call I’ve answered has been some of the most wholesome conversations.

Do yourself a favor, and help out and install this app.",04/29/18 18:44,2,5

I mean really, you have no reason to not download this app and help someone when it’s your turn to pick up a call.. it’s so easy and makes you feel good. Being nice is free.. so is helping the blind.",07/22/21 0:51,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This application is very useful in many situations. Working with a live volunteer can be very helpful.
With the recent release of the B, my AI, the artificial intelligence feature, I was very excited to get descriptions in any situation! And, it does a great job… As long as there are no people in the photo!
Recently I asked it to describe a photo where My Wife was sitting on a slide on an old time rocket ship in a children’s playground. The AI refused!
There are other apps that will do it, seeing AI from Microsoft will do it, the basic descriptions in my iPhone will describe it. They don’t do a good job, but at least they tell me there’s a person sitting on a slide. So be my eyes needs to drop this fear of describing photos with people in them, and update the application so that blind people can get true descriptions of everything in the world around us even people!",09/18/23 18:52,2;3,1

Cash Reader for the Blind,"This is a wonderful app for blind users. I am an American touring  here in Thailand.  I do not speak much Thai and spoken English here is not spoken regularly either. So, paying bills in a restaurant and receiving Thai currency change  can be an issue at times. However, when I pay my bill and I am given the change in the receipt book I no longer need to hassle with the waitress  to tell me the Thai Boht bills I am handed back to me. I bought the lifetime subscription and I am more than pleased I did. Thanks for this app and  all your hard work. In its development.",08/10/19 4:28,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I don't know how real the visually impaired people on this app are. Today I got a call from a person with his rear camera on and I could very clearly see there were a lot of visually active people around him in that they were all moving freely in a field doing normal activities easily, I don't know how to explain it but none of them were blind, they were all present within a two arm distance of the caller. Was the caller not blind? Couldn't he have taken their help? Don't think I'll answer now",08/01/21 21:59,6,1

Be My Eyes,"I would love to give this app, a higher rating and I would have except that it’s recent behavior is frustrating. I use the app mainly for reading mail. Occasionally, it will tell me that it can’t read the recipients name or address, because it is not supposed to disclose information from an image. To me, that kind of defeats, the purpose of using the app for reading mail as a blind person. yet, other times, it will read the mail, including giving me the name and recipients address. So the inconsistent application of this rule is confusing. But ultimately, the real frustration is that it applies this rule in the first place, meaning that I can’t always use this app, because I have to switch to another app to read the image. In  other respects, though, Be My Eyes is wonderful at describing images and scenes. when I sent a message about being frustrated, with the fact that it wouldn’t disclose this information, it responded that I could cover the personal information with the piece of paper and that way it wouldn’t reveal such information. This implied then that it would reveal all the information if I didn’t cover the page, but that wasn’t the case. since this behavior just started in the last month, I’m presuming that it might be a response related to how the European Union wants Apple to handle images. So, this is why I’ve rated the app reluctantly as a three star rating.",03/07/24 19:13,2;3,3
Be My Eyes,"I shouldn’t encourage others to join since it might decrease my chances to get a call. However, helping individuals with low vision makes me so happy, I can’t help it. It’s so easy - you get a video call and help someone “see” what they need to see. There’s no pressure if you can’t take a call since one of the millions of other volunteers is eager and ready. I truly appreciate this simple way to help others.",01/01/23 4:54,1,5

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,"This app is terrible. It couldn't even ascertain where I was. The voice guiding you, it was telling me I was 2 doors away. It sounds retarted and instead of saying Road it said r d. It gave the name of a local pub, The Centenery as The Centurian! It showed businesses that no longer exist. When telling you where bus stops are it was saying 'in front of you'. There is a row of houses in front of me!

The one problem I have with this is the cancel ""x"" buttons. I'm not blind, but I found it hard to hit the ""x"" button. I feel like there could be a bother or better option to cancel the photo by, say, shaking the phone, double-tapping, etc. I think this app will go a long way!",07/12/17 20:03,1;3,5

OneStep Reader,Don't waste your time and especially your money! I would rate this app with zero stars if Google would allow it. I couldn't even evaluate this piece of crAPP.

Supersense is extremely good at reading any amount of text without charge!,04/16/20 16:48,3,1
Lazarillo Accessible GPS,So far I am very happy with this app. I am visually impaired and I use this app and more more it amazes me of how accurate it is.

Be My Eyes,"Although I appreciate this service and have helped people with this app, I feel this app is lacking in the ability to choose the hours of availability making it limited to only some people who need assistance or are willing to offer assistance. For instance what is someone who is blind needs help outside of the 8am - 9pm times? What about people who work overnight hours and need assistance or want to be available to help someone during the night?",11/19/22 13:30,3,3

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The OKO app was once an innovative and essential tool for blind and visually impaired individuals. Its core focus helping users cross streets safely with reliable AI was groundbreaking. It simplified a critical aspect of independent travel, and the five-star reviews from its earlier days reflect just how effective it was at meeting this need.

Unfortunately, as the app has expanded its feature set, it has lost sight of what made it great. While apps like GoodMaps Outdoors and VoiceVista excel in navigation, OKO now struggles to keep up in this space, becoming a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. The new features, while perhaps well-intentioned, dilute the app’s primary purpose and compromise its reliability.

Adding to this disappointment is the introduction of a subscription model. For a once simple and effective tool, the cost is unjustifiable, especially given its diminished value in comparison to free or more robust alternatives. It feels like an unnecessary expense for many in the visually impaired community, myself included.

I truly hope the developers reevaluate their approach and refocus on OKO’s original strengths. Until then, I cannot recommend this app as an essential, but more of a nice to have",01/22/25 1:51,3,3

I thought this kind of app up years ago but imagined it would be trusted white-collar crime prisoners trying to get early parole by being kind of a remote seeing eye dog for blind people walking outside - or reading to kids who had illiterate parents.

Be My Eyes,Honestly the best app I’ve seen yet. I wish I would get more calls though. I’ve had the app for a year and I’ve only gotten a total of three calls. The first two weren’t answered quick enough although I immediately clicked accept. I was lucky to get through to someone yesterday & I keep thinking about it. I am so grateful to have been able to help a visually impaired person in need of help to check if someone was in her house. I ended up talking to her for a few minutes and realized we were state neighbors. It truly made my heart happy and made me want to do this more. SEND US MORE CALLS!!! Some of us LOVE it.,04/27/22 20:56,2,5
Be My Eyes,Excellent idea. Well done to the creators for this app. More blind/ vision impaired people should be aware of this app and hopefully the creators can make a bigger awareness off this app in the blind/vision impaired community,03/25/23 6:08,1,5
Be My Eyes,I joined at the end of October and have just had  my first call today. A lady needed me to read the labels on 4 packets so she knew what they were. It is a great feeling being able to help somebody who is visually impaired achieve what they’re trying to do.,12/04/22 5:28,1,5

Seeing AI,"Very good at doing so many things and a fun way to play around with image detection AI!  Barcode reader is the best one I've ever used. Face detection seems extremely well implemented, I was able to quickly take a nicely framed up selfie using the back camera and the audio cues from the app. It tells you the subject's gender, age, and mood.  And then there's the scene detection where you take a picture and it does its best to describe what it sees. It's not always accurate but it's usually pretty close, and sometimes it can come up with some interesting feedback. 

Everything feels VERY snappy, at least on my iPhone 7 Plus on my home WiFi. The voice is so responsive and quick that using the app feels almost futuristic at times. This is the main thing that differentiates this from things I've seen before. It feels a bit like an Apple product— none of these AI technologies is new, but it's the first time they are all together in one accessible place and so well executed. 

The only thing that didn't work for me was the document detection feature, I tried many times to scan a receipt on A4 paper from an online purchase and it appeared to recognize the geometry of the paper very well and quickly asked me to hold still but then said there wasn't any text found while displaying a black screen where there would normally be an image. Apparently a minor bug which I hope they'll hammer out in the next release. 

I truly believe this app will help many people with vision impairment. Thank you for your hard work on making something great!",07/13/17 3:21,1;3,5
Seeing AI,Love this app. I lost my vision three years ago and was told that this app is very useful. I use it almost daily on the go in at home. Everything works pretty seamless except for the color reader which can be kind of an accurate at times. It would be amazing if you guys can add some thing that would be able to read digital clocks. Unfortunately a lot of my devices in my home have digital clocks like my stove my washing machine my thermostat etc. I do use a lot of smart devices in my home but some of them are not able to be hooked up to my smart devices. So it would be pretty cool if I could hold the phone in front of the stove to see what temperature the oven is on or how much time is left on the washing machine etc. Overall absolutely love this application. Keep up the good work,10/25/21 6:03,1;2;4,4
Be My Eyes,"My blind uncle told me he used this app to help him. He recently passed away and it reminded me to install it, and I'm glad I did. I just helped someone with their dinner, they wanted to know what canned goods they had.

To think that without this app someone would have tried to make dinner and would have had to open cans at random. Now as I type this a blind man is eating the dinner he wanted to prepare, not eat what he accidentally opened.

 I love several of the channels that this app provides. The product, document and short text are great. The document channel especially is great. I purchase another app a while back for $100 and this app works better. I love that I do not have to presss a button to take the picture. 
I found the person channel fun, but not very useful. I do not find the color channel accurate. I have better success with tap tap See for colors. I used the color channel on a white shirt and when it was on the sleeves it would say grey and on the front or back of the shirt it would say brown. 
The currency channel is just as good as the other apps  available It is very accurate.",11/09/18 17:02,1;3,5
OneStep Reader,"Didn't work at all. I heard it was on the braille note touch plus that I'm researching. After Installing it said ""thank you for evaluating"" and asked if I wanted to unlock unlimited. It wouldn't even let me try it to see if it was right for my blind 12yo. None of the buttons did anything and no help available. So much for that program.",07/08/20 15:32,3,1

Be My Eyes,"I just got to help someone find a couple cans of stewed tomatoes in their pantry! It was very quick, less than 30 seconds between getting the notifications and them having their tomatoes. My day is made! 😊

I've actually had this app for over a year and this is the first time I've gotten to ""be someone's eyes"". I hope that means other people are really quick to help, and not that most blind people who might need help don't know about the app.

This app is a really great idea, and it works! ❤️",05/16/17 21:03,2,5
Be My Eyes,I downloaded the app because I thought it was a cool idea.  Little did I know I’d get my first call within a couple of days.  I was so nervous when I saw it was a Be My Eyes call I almost couldnt answer!  😁. I had the opportunity to help a gentlemen with his dinner.  I felt so good afterwards.  I’ve had vision issues so I can understand both sides of how this works.  It’s easy to get started and there are tips and a video on how to be a volunteer.This is a fabulous idea and so glad I signed up!,05/12/23 13:07,1,5

Be My Eyes,"As a volunteer in this app, helping others out makes me feel good! My busy schedule doesn't allow me to go out and physically volunteer places, along with medical reasons. But that made me think... Perhaps you could create other ""good deed"" apps! For example, for the deaf, the deaf blind, and for other people with disabilities. I would download and volunteer for all of them in a heartbeat! I hope that's something that'll one day be considered. Anyways, this app is lovely and makes me feel so good, as I hope it does with others! Small acts of kindness like this app allows are what lights up my day.",11/14/17 23:44,3,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I wanted something like this for a long time. Since I can’t see the crossing signals, I would typically use my Magnifier app to locate and magnify the signal so I can see it and then when it’s safe to cross now, this app picks up the signal well before I reach the curb and let me know what the current state of the crossing signal is when a single changes to walk, I am immediately notified and can proceed across the street as long as the camera can focus on the signal the application quickly communicates changes in the crossing signal.

THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE GAME CHANGER FOR TGE SAFETY OF BLIND AND LOW VISION USERE EVERY WHERE!!!!!!!

Thank you for defending this app.",05/05/23 2:34,2,5
Seeing Eye GPS,"I'm not sure exactly what it is, but something about this particular subscription model bothers me. Part of it is the subscription price itself. I think this particular application would be more accessible to more users with a monthly subscription that would cost around $10 per month. That way, your bottom line is still the same without making accessibility cost prohibitive to blind Users.",07/17/13 21:59,3,3
Lookout - Assisted vision,Thank you developers this app is very intelligent for blind persons,07/12/21 4:47,1,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"This app was recommended to me in August 2024 by my white cane trainer from the Virginia Department for the blind and visually impaired.  It seemed to provide a decent functionality for crosswalk walk/don’t walk signals.  I never got to test it in the challenging lighting conditions that gave me problems.  When I went to experiment with it to see if it could handle Austrian signals, I find that it has moved from being free to a SUBSCRIPTION model.  If the developer needed to make moat for development. they could have done a flat purchase price.  Instead they want to continually pick the pockets of blind and visually impaired people who already face much additional cost and inconvenience in life. Perhaps if the developers had stuck to the crosswalk capability, they wouldn’t be facing development costs for the additional bloat. The awards this app garner and many positive reviews came before their switch to SUBSCRIPTION and would not have been received with this model. Doubtless, based on other negative reviews, the developer will spend time and money on making a response, further increasing their “need” for a SUBSCRIPTION model.",02/24/25 9:13,3,1

Be My Eyes,I'm a visually impaired user of this app/ service.  I found it so delightful to observe that there are more people to volunteer rather than the beneficiaries which shows the potential of this app to become a catalyst in mainstreaming disability inclusion. The positive reviews of the sighted volunteers go onto show how much of a gratification they have gained through the interactions they've made with blind people with it.,12/28/17 12:38,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve read the stories on the app and noticed a theme. People say “I was hesitant to use that app to ask for help” and the other people say “I love it when I get the chance to assist someone.” 
I totally identify with not wanting to ask for help. When I was younger I had my pride and thought I could do everything myself. Now that I’m a little older I realize it has nothing to do with pride. My time is valuable. If asking for help saves me grief and time then yo better believe I am asking for help. There are 17 volunteers to every low or no vision user, so don’t hesitate in asking for help. People volunteer because they want to. You’re not going to be bothering anybody. 
I got the app two weeks ago and am excitedly waiting for my first opportunity to help",07/28/18 0:04,1,5
Be My Eyes,"The best app for the blind and visually impaired. The Be My AI feature is so useful for reading things like menus and text in general. The descriptions of scenes aren't as detailed as other apps but this app has so much more to it, and they finally added audio description to Be My AI, not sure why it took so long but it's great to have that for people who don't want a constant screen reader on their phone.

TapTapSee,"For a free app, this one isn't bad. It recognized all that currency bills I presented it, and most of the various products. However, there should be a repeat feature. What if the person did not hear what was read the first time?
Also, under the about heading, there is no apparent text. At least voiceover does not see it. What is the point of having an about heading when there is no text present?
Aside from these things, this app is pretty neat. I hope it continues to be further developed, and it certainly has the potential to be extremely useful for those of us who are visually impaired.",01/17/13 20:19,1;3,3

As of today, I've helped 2 people with a task and a question; and it gives me a good feeling knowing that I am helping someone get thru their day!

If that is all it was this would be a great app. But it just doesn't ""see"" the barcode to begin with. App should been free or at least no more than $3.",08/12/12 18:52,3,1

does anyone know if the same type of app exists for hearing?  so far the apps i have found are for automatic transcriptions, but if people could actually ""hear"" for others, nuances can be identified, such as ""what is this vibration?""  ""is this machine making the correct sound?""  ""is anything beeping in my house?""  ""are there any warning sounds right now?""  ""is my dog barking outside?"" ""are the birds singing?""  Be My Eyes already has a strong dedicated community, wouldn't it be amazing if hearing impaired people can also be helped just like this?

easy. The lady had a box of cheddar potatoes and needed to know what the 
box was and asked me to read the directions. Other than a few times asking 
her to move the phone right or left it was very easy and took less than 10

I just need to confirm the last four digits of the card. However, this gentleman wants to take a picture is that were speaking with him and he's telling me he's such a good person, she's really trustworthy.

He said nine transactions to cash app I got the emails are the freight other I called back the bank had to lock it and had them send me a new card. I reported this to be my eyes, they didn't respond. They suspended my account for how long I don't know. They said I violated their policies so now I'm literally in the dark without Aiden support, especially from the my eyes I have a gentleman's name and other information on him, but it would be my eyes do not ask me for his information so what that means is that this gentleman is a predator and he's going to pray on peoples disabilities.

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The update made it completely unusable for those of us who are blind, and hearing impaired. Now it doesn’t automatically open to the cross street function. It opens to a map when you can’t hear on the go and use a braille display you can’t get it to where you can open the cross street function. It’s completely unusable now. I shouldn’t have to pair my braille display. Take it with me and do 30 functions every time. I’m at a street corner trying to cross the street. There are 80 apps out there that do point by point directions. I don’t need another one. Oko Was good because it was simple and it did one thing no other app did. now that is ruined.

ETA: from your response, I can’t tell if you are a bot or if you just don’t understand anything about Deafblind folks and how we use tech. First of all, although I, personally can voice, many DB people can’t. So a Siri shortcut isn’t going to work for many. It can also be hard even if you can voice in very noisy situations. Second, the button on the first screen than comes up when you open the app is in (or next to) the search field. It still takes a few steps to get there, instead of just opening the app and having it work. If you are DB and can’t hear voiceover and use braille display, or even if you are blind and at a loud intersection and can’t hear voiceover, this makes it difficult to impossible at every intersection to have to do this. No one wants to stand there and struggle at every intersection for 5 minutes screwing around with an app that used to just work upon opening and pointing. Third, I know how maps with turn by turn directions work. They’ve been around for decades. There’s the seeing eye app, find nearby, blind square and even just google among others. This feature does not enhance your product. You don’t need directions for every route you walk. You do get an advantage from getting intersection help. You are trying too hard. You took an innovative product that was elegant in its simplicity and ruined it. You can fix it by making an option, at least, to get the ped signal function immediately upon opening. Until then, the app is still unusable for many people and more difficult for everyone. Until it’s fixed, I would still give it 0 stars and that award you just won should really be revoked if you are going to screw the DB out of the app among many others. Yes, I am mad. You response was a condescending “sighted-splain.” Do better.",06/12/24 12:16,3,1

He has to use Siri to open the app but Siri won’t let him close the app to reset it, meaning someone with good sight has to do it for him (they could just read whatever he was trying to read at that point).
If it would open with the camera and nothing on the screen at all, and simply read text the camera saw it would be great.",04/07/23 7:53,3,1
Seeing AI,I was so excited to find this app for my mother who is completely blind. She uses the voiceover for all functions on her phone. When she went to use the app the voiceover recognized the buttons at the bottom as one large button instead of individuals. This makes it impossible to switch from say short text to product scanner. It’s always stuck on the short text button. It would be an amazing app if this wasn’t an issue. Sadly we’ll have to look for something else until this is fixed.,05/20/18 18:16,3,2

Enjoyed each succession and I am very proud to be a active user of the Seeing Eye GPS. I am a guy dog handler who travels daily as a pedestrian as a bus fixed route bus traveler as well as an Uber rider. I also travel by Gray hound, and I fly regularly. A GPS app as for most drivers is awesome and if you are blind, it is just as necessary. You are able to give directions actively as I do helping to navigate new communities with my friends. Even in my hometown we go new places and said of just sitting there waiting to get there, I can be an active part of the trip. I went to a party in a neighboring community with a friend or a couple months ago. It was a 30 mile trip and I was able to help my friend know were each turn was, and we arrived actually quicker than we thought we would she was very grateful for the app as well. So thank you send Darrow thank you for everyone who is a part of it and thank you for all that thank you for the partners such as Googal and others who contribute to the success of seeing a GPS.

It consistently missed the local grocery store and wanted to send me 30 miles away.   I could not cancel a search for a POI.  I could not save a POI or route.

Be My Eyes,I recently helped a blind couple by telling them how much water went in one of their recipes. I love this app and everything it does to help the community! 5 stars no doubt.,02/12/19 20:47,2,5
Be My Eyes,Awesome app for visually impaired individuals who need help with things we take for granted. I’ve answered a half dozen calls and it is simply GREAT.,09/30/21 14:49,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I love having this app on my phone. While I have only received two calls in the last 6 months (I was too late to answer my first call, but successfully answered the second call today!), it’s still amazing that I was able to help someone with something so small; something the rest of us take for granted every day. 

Today a woman called asking if I could help her adjust her thermostat. When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70°, so she counted the buttons up to 75° and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn’t need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) 

A lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn’t about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it. I think it’s wonderful that so many people volunteer, regardless of the number of people that need help.",12/16/19 19:10,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,The first time I was able to assist a visually impaired person felt wonderful. I help them set their thermostat and let them know how and where the commands work. Little things that make a world of difference to someone.,10/05/19 12:56,2,5
Be My Eyes,Have you thought about creating an app called be my ride? I live in an area without Uber or Lyft. Do you think sighted people would be willing to give blind people rides for gas money and a carrying fee or something? This could bridge a huge gap in transportation.,07/06/23 14:47,4,5

TapTapSee,This app is a blind man's dream. I've been waiting for something like this my whole life. Very impressed with how accurately it details whatever photos you take. This app will help anyone with a visual disability or someone totally blind become independent.,07/11/15 18:03,1;2,5

Seeing AI,"When you open the app if there was a better way to access channels by gesture it would be very beneficial. 

My blind friend received notification of software update. App became unusable because she can’t see where to press in the notification box to remove the notification and begin using the app. Either don’t have the notification appear or give a gesture to accept or dismiss the notification to begin using the app. 

Pause button too close to channel bar. Accidental press too easy. 

This is a wonderful app and amazing technology but there are several improvements that would actually help blind people.",05/18/18 9:48,3;4,4
Seeing AI,"This app is literally a dream come true for not only people who are blind or low vision but also for the profoundly dyslexic or otherwise print disabled people. My son is profoundly dyslexic and despite being 14 years old his ability to read print with his eyes is less than a first grade equivalent.  We have tried and use many apps and other technologies to help him access the world of print. Despite his struggles, he is a voracious consumer of audiobooks and this app allows him to access print around the environment with so much less effort than other apps. It also has very good accuracy. I also think the facial expression recognition feature has potential to assist people with Autism. Frankly, this app is just plain wonderful!!!!",11/13/19 17:36,1;4,5

Be My Eyes,My sister in law Debbie was blind. We recently lost her but she would have loved to have had the chance to use something like this to help her.

He started asking personal questions about me. He got very excited that I was American. He told me he was from Algeria. I asked him one more time if he needed help. He asked why he had to be blind. At this point I hung up on him. 

He asked where I lived, my age, if I was married and if I had children.",10/15/19 17:31,6,1

Seeing AI,"Pro’s -
• Does what it says, how it says without glitches or ads.
• Doesn’t try to profit off the disability of others, giving us what comes free to others.
Con’s -
• People Recognition has to be done by taking their picture & many refuse to allow that. It would be easier if it can be done by a previously taken photo. This way permission isn’t needed to know who is around you!
• Vague description on objects & animals. Would love to know if it’s my dachshund or Chihuahua eating or just came in, I already know both are dogs!
Tips -
• To be a navigational assistance as well can erase the need of multiple apps & can be the one stop shop for the blind!
• Adding the option to use previous taken photos to recognize those around us.

I wish more visually impaired people knew about it. There’s way more volunteers then people needing help so it’s not like your phone will be ringing off the hook all the time. I’ve gotten less than 20 calls in the years I’ve had the app. I have it always running so it can call anytime. I actually wish I could get more calls. The people I’ve helped have always been friendly! I’ve never had a negative experience or a person I couldn’t help!",07/23/20 7:58,1;2,5
Seeing AI,"Had I left a rating sooner, it would be 5 stars. For the past several months, text detection has gotten worse. I use the app frequently to identify canned foods, and the short text feature was great for this. It would immediately start reading the cans. Now it takes me a couple minutes just to get it to read anything useful from the can to know what it is. Having an iPhone 14 Pro camera makes no difference from when I had a 12 Mini. One would think a better camera would help. Recent app updates hasn't improved anything for me either. Now I mostly use it for light detection to turn lights off at night. This is still a good app for a free service that is useful to the blind.",12/11/22 19:20,3,3

OneStep Reader,"OK, simply put, if your visually impaired in anyway that you were not able to read text normally, I highly recommend this app, in fact, this app is far more superior to my Parul camera that I have on my computer. That being said, there are two issues, either that or huge but would be nice if they got fixed.

1. Batchmode - this mode allows you to take photos of multiple pages before the app processes the images into text to read to you. The problem is that this mode has a tendency to crash randomly, making the user have to routinely save the batch every 15–20 pages.

2. Photos - for whatever reason, this app holds onto the photos of the pages. This makes sense for legally blind users who want to see any photos that were on the page, but for the 95% of the rest of the time it makes this app a major memory hog if you use it a lot or if you use it to say scan a text book for school. I would really recommend the developers to give the option to delete the photos to help conserve memory on smart phones as well as when it backs up to the cloud.

Side from those two things, yes the price is very steep but it is so worth it if you prefer to just have all of your visually impaired and blind tools on one device rather than walking around like Batman with the utility belt.",02/03/16 11:14,3,4
Seeing AI,"The app is very good for blind and low vision. I have been told about this snap numerous of times. And I find that it is very useful because it helps us with the following tasks that we as individuals do from day today. From coming home after work, or school and checking our mail is able to read our mail to us so we don’t have to look for sighted assistance, being able to identify products such as food soda and chips etc. And being able to identify current sea, as well as take pictures.

Seeing AI,I was so excited to find this app for my mother who is completely blind. She uses the voiceover for all functions on her phone. When she went to use the app the voiceover recognized the buttons at the bottom as one large button instead of individuals. This makes it impossible to switch from say short text to product scanner. It’s always stuck on the short text button. It would be an amazing app if this wasn’t an issue. Sadly we’ll have to look for something else until this is fixed.,05/21/18 1:16,3,2

Seeing AI,"Overall, I have found this app very useful and accomplishing day-to-day tasks such as identifying canned goods or sorting the mail. However, it is very inconsistent ( and unacceptably so) in its ability to read the output of digital displays. FYI, I am speaking throughout this review of the short text channel. I use this app every day to read my kitchen scale for making coffee and for other reasons. At times, it reads the output quickly and accurately. At other times, it takes a very, very, very, very, very long time to read the display. Words are inadequate to describe the frustration I feel when a 30-second task turns into a 10-minute one, draining my phone battery all the while. If a pair of human eyeballs can read the display, then there should be no reason why Seeing AI cannot also read it. This problem seems particularly exacerbated by readings that end in either 1 or 7 (such as 21 G). The app has no problem reading the labels of the buttons on the scale, but it all too often fails to read literally the only thing on the display I want to hear. Perhaps a new channel could be created in the app that is optimized specifically for the reading of displays. Please work on this! In a world in which many home appliances are still inaccessible, it is more important than ever that blind people have access to an app like Seeing AI that is capable of reading a display. My rating reflects the frustration caused by the app's seeming inability to accomplish one of its core functions in situations that I need it most. I commit to updating my rating when this issue is addressed.",04/26/24 11:08,1;3,2

Be My Eyes,This is a really useful app for people who are visually impaired . There just needs to be a way to track its use . I wish  it would somehow annotate how many times i've helped out people .,02/21/18 21:12,1;4,4
Be My Eyes,I had a dear friend that was visually impaired before cell phones. This would have been such a huge help for her and I miss her everyday.  This is my way of giving back to a community she was a part of.,11/22/22 2:05,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I just had first call. It was male user asking me ""can you tell me what is this"" showing to the pen on the table next to laptop. That wasn't something blind person wouldn't recognize. Are you sure that people are not misusing this app?",04/10/23 1:23,6,3
TapTapSee,I got this for my blind father. He is still learning to use it but even I have fun trying to stump the app! I hope in the future the app will improve and advance so it could read everything and that the camera was more like the one on the money reader app. He can't tell if the pic is in focus when he takes it.,10/22/13 16:34,2;3,4

Be My Eyes,I am blind and use every day! ThisHelped me when my voiceover quit working on my computer I called probably around 20 people throughout two weeks and they were so kind and helpful. This is help me when my alarm clock stopped voicing and the alarm like dots didn’t work I call people every night for a month and they were so helpful. One night I was having a really bad panic attack and I called someone and explain situation they talk to me for five minutes because this is the only way I know how to get a hold of someone quickly.,11/06/21 3:41,2,5
TapTapSee,The clean simple design of this app makes it one of the best tools a visually impaired person will need for daily living skills.,06/29/13 10:04,1,5
Be My Eyes,I really love this app in the way that it helps people. I’ve had this for about two years now and have been able to answer about four calls. I help someone make a homemade pizza and also help someone get things at the grocery store! I get the calls every so often but normally someone always picks up before I can which is great that someone can be helped! Unfortunately my last call was an extremely rude person and a VERY inappropriate. Not sure how this app could filter that sort of thing because it’s not like you can ask someone prove that blind or not! 😬 i’ve seen lots of negative posts about this sort of thing and I am going to keep the app just in case I can help someone who is actually needing it and will just hang up on the inappropriate rude people.,02/11/21 8:20,6,4
Be My Eyes,"As someone who is blind, this is an amazing app. I love using the be my AI image description features in this app. They’re very detailed and spot on.

received one call so far and it was a pleasant one. However i do wish there 
was a option, in say a future update where you can select available or 
unavailable. In a video I saw which got me excited to try this app it 
states that if during the middle of the night it would connect a visually 
impaired individual in the UK. Which likely the best avenue. However in my 
situation I work 12 hour days and 12 hour graveyard shifts rotating each 
week, so having a option to say I'm available now or certain times during 
the day or night. Would be useful for me. I suppose if there are enough 
users it hardly matters. Just my two cents.",07/12/18 3:41,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,"Two strangers that shared a moment of love, helpfulness and kindness. Hoped for eachother the best and went their separate ways.

Seeing AI,"this app is the best all in one computer vision for the blind there is. I was sitting in a car and pointing the camera out the window and it was reading the signs. I used the scene recognition on myself and it said ""man with brown hair, wearing sunglasses,  taking a selfy"". I also was looking at wrinkled papers in the car on my lap and the ocr was almost perfect. I also love that it takes only a few seconds to find the barcode where as with other apps, it takes me 5-10 minutes. The best part, this is free!!! Microsoft, even though Windows 10 is terrible and you don't user test the surface pro with blind people, this puts your rating back to positive. This is one of the most amazing apps to have come out for blind people. thank you!",07/14/17 8:02,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"There’s nothing so gratifying than helping people. Individuals come with individual needs, so you never know what sort of questions you’ll be asked. All of them are important, and this app is changing lives for the better, both for visually-impaired people and for those who receive their call.

My only beef? More than 5M assistants and 500k visually-impaired persons on the app means that I’m always attempting to answer the call before someone else! :::chuckle::: All in all, though, I think that’s a good thing!",06/09/22 11:14,1,5

Be My Eyes,I think this is a great idea to help the blind! Cudos to the developers!,08/04/19 21:06,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I have used this app for a year now and I love the concept of being able to help people. I have set my languages up for Spanish and English. I have not taken any English calls and always get Spanish calls which doesn’t concern me.

Some of the calls I get are people asking if I can read signs for them, Count money for them, read blood glucose readings, and so on. 

I don’t know why but the whole month of November I have been getting strange calls from people Spanish speaking asking me questions about how they can find me, where I am from, what’s my phone number or FB name. It’s making me want to delete the app. I have reported the calls but I haven’t received follow ups it makes me wonder are they really taking care of these people accounts there probably not blind at all. 

The last call really freaked me out he was whispering and very creepy and asking me all kinds of questions like if I am alone, if I like to party where do I live when I repeated to him how can I help you ? He said “ ohhh you can help me plenty it’s all ready for you. It grossed me out so much I hung up immediately and reported it. 

Use at your own risk I’ll be deleting this app unfortunately.",11/26/18 4:57,6,1

Be My Eyes,"I would love to give this app more stars because it is a great idea and has helped people already. However, the developer makes the same mistake that a lot of folks do when it comes to the visually impaired. In order to use this as a blind person you have to have Voiceover turned on in the Accessibility section. Not all people that qualify as blind are totally blind. There is a good sized population that have some vision that don't use the Voiceover feature. I downloaded the app, thinking it would be great for me when I need help reading something. I tried out the Voiceover feature and did not like it at all. Since I don't like it, I can't use the app. Don't assume all blind people do things in the same way. Let us choose what accessibility features we want to use.",12/21/15 3:24,3,2
Be My Eyes,"That app was awesome when I worked, now it just says its trying to connect. It's frustrating but I could only imagine it being even more frustrating for the visually impaired person who needs the help but can't receive any when the app won't load",11/26/21 20:09,3,1

OneStep Reader,"This is a great app for single-page scanning! With a couple fixes it could be great for multi-page scanning, too (more about that below).

Bought at $50 (50% off the regular $100 price), its OCR has proven very accurate and quick, amazing me at how it can accommodate automatically for slightly curved pages and such. I appreciate how you can add pages to existing files at any time. Thanks to the developers who continue to refine the app!

While it is over 90% there, it is too rough for a $50 app (let alone $100 at the regular price). Scanning a document over 35-40 pgs consistently causes the app to crash. (I've resorted to scanning longer documents into multiple 35-page files in knfbReader, a rather untidy but functional workaround.) The app also lacks bookmarking, an essential feature for multi-page documents, especially for the visually impaired. I have resorted to exporting the text as a txt file and importing it into the Voice Dream app, which has superior text-to-voice and ereader capabilities than knfbReader (e.g. use a slider to move forward and back through the text, higher quality voices, automatic bookmarking saves where you left off, syncs with Pocket, displays the amount of time it would take to listen to a selection next to the name, etc.)

Note: I've noticed that the device you use to scan can make a significant difference in scan speed. Changing from an iPod touch 5th gen to an iPhone 6 doubled my scan speed, in part due to faster focusing. When possible, scanning two facing pages of a book at a time doubled my scanning speed again. Tip: Use as bright a light as possible to speed up focus time and, therefore, scan time's under lower light conditions focusing can take considerably longer.

A couple other requests include: 
- Cloud syncing between devices without requiring manually exporting from one device and importing into the app on another device
- More polished user interface

I am sighted and use this app to increase the number of articles and books I can go through by listening instead of reading. I tend to listen to more audiobooks than I read paper books, and my hope is to make more paper articles and books readily accessible in audio form. This app is a great example of how improving accessibility for some can improve it for all. 

In short, knfbReader is a diamond in the rough. At this price, I expect better quality. Once the crashing and bookmarking have been worked out, it could be magnificent. (Then, I would give it 5 stars.) The developers are actively working on it, so with continued effort they may yet refine knfbReader into a solid app worthy of the price.",12/26/17 8:44,3,4

I got some help from a guy from Australia.  I had a lady helping me sort through my mail from Korea. I love the patience and dedication from the volunteers.

The need for trained sighted guides is paramount for the lives of people who have no sight, trust is essential. This task requires the highest degree of empathy and selflessness. I guess the question is, how do we find the selfless folks who can donate their time from all walks of life in all languages because they not only care, but have experience helping the blind. It might be an impossible task, but one worth pursuing. Thank you for your time.",10/07/20 6:52,1,5

Be My Eyes,"This App really makes it easy to be the eyes for someone with low vision or even blindness.  You answer a special ring tone if you have time (usually about 10 mins or so) if not someone else probably can get it.  I always try to make time when I can.  The callers need help with rather simple tasks and they know what they need but not being able to see is their only obstacle.  With CoVid 19 isolating low sighted and blind persons from their normal support group of sighted friends and family has left them in a lurch.  Once it was helping a lady find the right bills to pay for grocery delivery,  once helping a lady read her prescription number to a pharmacist over the phone, helping someone who needed to match an outfit for a job interview (not used to wearing business clothes) and helping with computer issues.  Nothing has been too hard or too time consuming and the feeling of being able to help someone pick the right train track can be a godsend to the person on the other end.  Reminds me not to take my sight for granted. The callers are very respectful of your time and truly appreciate the help.",09/23/20 1:49,2,5

I if you happen have the old version keep a hold of it and do not update it. t seems like that's a high price. This app is so good that I took a picture of a tv screen and it told me who was playing, that it was basketball, and that the score was 36 to 55 and the winning team.. Wow. I also regularly use it to snap photos of items that I can't identify. I am totally blind. And I can snap photos from inside of a car and it never fails to tell me what we are driving by. For example, it said at one point today ""photo of a car in parking lot with green trees and a brown grassy field nearby. "" this was taken from a moving car. Another great use of this app is to snap photos of food to make sure it is what you want to open. Snap a photo of each side of a box of food and it will analyze each side of it. Snap photos of people and it tells you what kind of shirt they are using. Amazing.",11/12/13 19:13,3,3
Be My Eyes,"Much like what Bart Ouwerkerk said 5 days ago in his Jan.25,'21 review, I absolutely LOVED the idea of this app. My maternal grandmother was at the forefront of Braille translation, doing thousands of papers & books into Braille for many decades until she passed in 1974, & this app/idea felt like a tiny connection to her - a simple, fine way to assist the visually challenged. So I installed the app about 2-1/2 years ago. And then?...Zero. Zippo. Zilch! Not *one single call* in well over a year. Living where I do in N.E. of U.S. - a highly populated area of the world & just 25 miles from Manhattan - you'd think there'd be SOMEONE around (w/in 50 mile radius at least, w/so many cities nearby, much less globally!) that needed help at some point, but nope, not a one!

Seeing AI,The only reason why I downloaded this was to see if it could register my penis sadly it did not must have been too small ☹️ but the other objects I pointed it at were really accurate also how will a blind person find the button to take the picture you should add the feature where you press the volume button to take the pic,06/09/18 8:54,-1,4
Seeing AI,I am blind but unfortunately I cannot use this app with VoiceOver. The app does not announce the tab names and buttons. Once it does something - for example opens a dialog “product was not found” — it’s impossible to close it — without asking for help from someone who can actually see. This defeats the whole purpose of this app.,09/08/22 20:38,3,1
Be My Eyes,This apps is good for helping for the blind.,10/06/17 21:37,1,5

Be My Eyes,"What a marvelous idea! I’m blind, and though I’m very independent, I struggle with situations that aren’t issues for fully sighted people. For example, I frequently misplace things — often just out of reach. After groping around, often on hands & knees on the floor, I give up in frustration. With “Be My Eyes,” I get immediate assistance locating dropped or misplaced items. Thank you so much for this very clever and handy app!",07/03/20 11:02,2,5
Seeing AI,"Hello:

I am a totally blind person who thoroughly enjoys using the Seeing AI app. Just a quick note to let you know that I absolutely love the Seeing AI app. I absolutely love it's many features, and it is truly a life-changing app. I use the short text feature when I want to find out who may have sent me mail, or if I want to find out something about a flyer or something like that. I also really enjoy using the product feature where I can read information about everything from bags of skittles to chips and other things such as canned goods.

We worked together with such joy, great teamwork and accomplished what the blind person needed help with. On top of that, I noticed he had a leak in his ceiling he was unaware of that was huge and puckered with water. It was amazing as I’m based in CA and he is in FL. Distance doesn’t matter! It took about 10 minutes and I learned a bit about humanity and basic life necessity. It was humbling. The app is user friendly as a volunteer! I hope it is the same for the blind users! I’m an advocate and tell everyone about it!",11/25/17 21:17,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I just finished watching this thriller on Netflix called “See for me” about a blind girl needing assistance during a home invasion. Never knew anything like this remotely existed in my whole entire life!! I’m so excited! I downloaded it last nite right after the movie and just got my 1st call from a kid that needed me to “see” for him as he was discovering his new iPhone 15. The call was less than a minute and his issue was resolved. As someone with optic neuritis (I’ve gone completely blind before) but with help of MS meds, I recovered my eyesight…at least for now….I can’t tell you guys how excited I am for this new technology!!!! I’m sobbing inside, cause if I become blind again, at least I’ll have this kind of service to help me. And as long as I can see for now, I’ll be volunteering and helping blind people as much as I can!!! Thank you app developer!!!!!!!!! May God bless you!!!!!",10/09/24 2:27,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"Everyone remember the point of this app is to help people who can't see.. it's not about the poor connection or if people are rude sometimes (people have bad days), it's about helping someone that's legally blind. I've only help 4 people in about 2 or 3 years but that's okay because it's not about me, it's about the people I help. Everyone should download this app! It's amazing and everyone has been so nice!",03/16/17 12:53,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I am a sighted person who receives calls from blind people seeking help, and I cannot express how it fills my heart to know that even on days that I stay in my pajamas, I can be of service to another person. Even something as small (to me) as indicating the color of socks laid out in front of my screen, clearly makes an impact on the person calling. I’ve talked to lovely people and encourage more people who are no and multilingual to join. There are many times over the volunteers versus the blind, but I imagine not a huge amount with that skillset. I’d highly recommend this app, either way. It truly does make a difference for both parties and I am grateful to have been able to partake in it. Such an intelligent and awesome way to solve a problem that lifts the burden off someone who may otherwise have to seek out family or friends who aren’t right there with them.",05/11/19 18:07,2,5

I’m just happy for my small interactions with visually impaired people around the world.",01/09/23 5:06,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,I thought this would be great to help the blind but it doesn't work properly. First I signed up to help but only got a call once and it didn't connect me. You almost never get a call as a helper because this app lies to you! When you look at the amount of helpers it will give you something like this: 179.... What that really means is there are 179 thousand helpers. I know this because I also signed up as a blind person and saw the truth there. Worst part is I made a call for help it never connected me to anybody. This app is a disgrace and should be deleted because their updates haven't fixed anything.,02/06/15 20:54,3,1

Be My Eyes,"Downloaded this app in JAN 2019 and have been answering calls all these years without incident. App is updated regularly and works flawlessly. There is lots of help in the app as to how to answer a call and how to help the person calling who needs assistance. I have my sight, so I am the one who receives calls to help a visually impaired person with a daily task. Calls ring my phone and if I do not pick up quickly or choose not to pick up, the call rolls over to the next volunteer. The voice connection is always clear. Early on in my volunteering, I received a call about once a month that lasted about 5 -10 minutes. Lately, I receive a call about every 4 to 6 months. I would be very happy to answer more calls. The people on the other end of the line are very appreciative of any help I can provide.

The only Two issues I am currently experiencing with the app are that I am not exactly pleased with the subscription model… I would have rather paid $200 for the life of the app. But, I am willing to pay the subscription because the app is worth it. The other thing I would like to see implemented in this app is public transportation directions for those of us Who live in larger cities that make use of public transportation. It would be amazing if this app could announce all of the stops as the bus/train approaches and Provide the next few times that the vehicle will come to your stop while you are waiting.",07/02/13 8:23,1;2;3,4

Seeing AI,"Update: someone recently asked me about useful apps for the blind. I told them that seeing AI app was like the Swiss Army knife for blind people. I think that is the Best way to describe this app.
 I love several of the channels that this app provides. The product, document and short text are great. The document channel especially is great. I purchase another app a while back for $100 and this app works better. I love that I do not have to presss a button to take the picture. 
I found the person channel fun, but not very useful. I do not find the color channel accurate. I have better success with tap tap See for colors. I used the color channel on a white shirt and when it was on the sleeves it would say grey and on the front or back of the shirt it would say brown. 
The currency channel is just as good as the other apps  available It is very accurate.",11/09/18 9:02,2,5

This morning i was at the store. I couldn't read a food label or find a person there to help me. I have some serious food allergies. The person read the label to me and when i didnt know one the person with her goggled it. Thus knew i couldnt safely eat it or id need to use my epipen. Thank you for having this available.

The only problem that I am seeing is it does not do a good job when you try to use it with those 2 L bottles of pop that people get Voice is not reading me any of the information the camera isn’t working and whether I use the short text or document mode it doesn’t work and doesn’t help and also voiceover is having trouble. It doesn’t say hold steady every time to know the cameras in the right place and lined up it’s not telling me every single time I think it’s a bug please fix all this if you can and add another mood for reading labels on 2 L bottles of pop.

Most free or minimal cost apps don't have consistent OCR identification accuracy, however this app puts most if not all which fall in the afore mentioned category to shame.

Hopefully that doesn’t ding me for future assistance. This is so easy to help blind or limited sight individuals with tasks sighted people take for granted.

Be My Eyes,"Wow! This is Amazing. 

The love of my life recommended I download the  -Be My Eyes- app on 07/25/2022 after another one of my rants about wanting to help more humans. One day later, 07/26/2022 (my guys exact bday) and I received my first call on the way to his birthday dinner in Long Beach. Boy, were we in for a Treat! 🍬 

I promptly answered and on the line was a easy going gentle manwith a warm and contagious smile. 😁 I was excited to hear of the task. How May I serve or assist you, sir? What is the task at hand?  He wanted me to explain what was happening on the television screen 📺 before him. I was delighted to play this part. 

Let’s get me a little closer to the TV. Perfect! 
What was he watching? America’s Got Talent! What was the act? A young international yo-yo 🪀 dancing pro! Delicious! (in my AbrahamHicks voice) This talented young act is Spectacular! He paraded across the stage dancing 🕺 and flipping with the yo-yos never breaking their stride. The crowd went wild! The judges were floored! I described each twirl and flair with enthusiasm! 

We all laughed in delight, my boyfriend included.
After that act, the tone was set. We hardly wanted to end this scene. He gave us some great words and we genuinely indulged in the feeling of being alive. His energy, amazing. It felt like winning a million dollars or talking to a good friend after a long time. I love this app. We wait patiently for our next call. There are no strangers here, just feels like a friend helping a friend. Faith in humanity restored. 💫✨ The Blind Man at a yo-yo show.

Funny story: We just got the ticket in the mail 08/08/2022 from East Los Angeles Police Department for running a red light 🚦during this moment of amazement. Stay safe, stay conscious This is our story 💓✨Namaste. 

Peace, love & light to you forever,

 to the man we laughed and shared with but who never saw our face. You are beautiful sir. We hope you will receive this message somehow.

Supersense - AI for Blind,"I had this in the “find” setting to find a person. It completely missed my friend beside me. Couldn’t find my shoes, a cup, and other objects. 
My friend has glaucoma and needs help finding things so I was hoping this would be a good solution. I’m very disappointed in this app. Trying to find a way to get my money refunded.",11/07/24 19:02,3,1

Supersense - AI for Blind,"Too expensive for a blind person on a fixed income that has no family or anybody to help out. We have to buy a lot of equipment, such as screen, readers, money, identifiers, color, identifiers, canes, backpack, to put all the merchandise Inn and the list goes on and on and on, and all of that stuff is extremely expensive. Not all of us have family and some of us do live totally on our own with no help for anybody.",02/02/24 9:17,3,2
Be My Eyes,One of the best apps ever.  I love answering calls to help blind people finding their way to solve daily tasks.,12/12/19 23:58,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I recommend everyone download this app. I’ve had some normal calls where I just helped people shop or change the thermostat. But the call I just received was just awesome. It was an elderly man from Dunedin, New Zealand. He needed help identifying bottles of liquor and I told him I was already in the process of drinking some whiskey. We ended up taking shots together and talking about life. Seriously this app is awesome. Will never forget this experience. Added note. When you do get a call, try to make it fun and memorable for them. They’re blind/impaired. Do anything you can to improve their quality life. You will see first hand how far some jokes and a positive attitude can go",12/09/21 7:17,2,5

Be My Eyes,"This is fantastic. It really does give blind and visually impaired people the assistance they need. I’ve had it for several months but never had the need to use it, but today I did. Wow, what an amazing thing. The only thing is though if you don’t know how to change front rear facing to front facing camera on your phone it can be a little challenging. But this is so cool, I highly recommend it. It is easy to use and it works fantastically well. Thanks to the creators",12/06/18 23:00,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Just answered my first call today and it felt so good! I helped a vision impaired lady count money and I felt really helpful. I loved the experience and I'm looking forwards to help more people.The app is pretty simple and straightforward, as it should be. Before receiving calls, you have to active them through watching a tutorial. It does support multiple languages, which is great. It's so nice to make some difference on people's lives, as little as it may seem. Be My Eyes is a must-have.",12/10/20 8:41,1,5
Be My Eyes,"App is installed on my phone. If someone who is visually impaired needs help, they initiate the app on their side. It pops up on my phone. If I am able to I answer it, I do. I have helped read directions on food, identify food from a freezer, read icons on a computer screen and a few other simple tasks. Sometimes I talk to the people for a few minutes also, sometimes it is quick and we are done. The people cannot see me and I can only see what they show me. I have never had a problem with audio or camera. We have always had good connections. I like meeting people from different places and being helpful when I can. It's a great app!",01/31/17 22:49,2,5
Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer since 2018 and have answered 5 calls. A few days ago I answered a call to help someone when I was having a moment (mourning my father’s passing) and that call came at the right time.

TapTapSee,"This app works incredibly well. It is amazing how many items  it can identify almost instantaneously even on older hardware. I believe I find the most use with this app at identifying cans of food which are almost impossible to identify with other  more expensive software such as knfb reader. I find that this app alongside  moneyreader and knfb  reader provide  of the identification and reading that I need to function completely independently. So why is this app yummy? Because without it I wouldn't know which can of soup I was opening.🍴🍜 I wholeheartedly recommend this application alongside cayenne FB reader and money reader as three absolute must have applications. If I could change anything about the app, would add a history that you could review after you reopen the app of the last four pictures. Notification of when the lens is covered or otherwise unable to get a picture before the picture is sent for processing. This would save time for the user and same time for those who must've been the find the pictures. Thanks for a great app!",11/02/15 19:26,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted helper it was easy to set up.

My blind friend Albert signed up but there is no option to choose a helper by rating or to set someone as their favorite so to call the same person again is impossible. Every call is to a random person.

It would be better to have a fav list and join up with the same persons or group of persons that we are familiar with from a previous call help building trust. 

Also need a personality profile for who you are talking to. Maybe a sound byte to hear their voice or choose a man or woman or age of helper or location to help with local needs.",02/01/15 22:01,3;4,3
Be My Eyes,"The idea is cool, but there are technical issues, the most important one is that the feedback does not work. Same as contact us, and at the end of call I was supposed totell how my call was, but the app crushed. This guy that called me is not even blind and just wanted to gather information from me. There is even no way to report these people.",10/26/21 13:05,5;6,2

Seeing AI,"This app makes my life much easier. While not being totally blind but with about 5% vision I can still see the little icons in the bottom. Haven’t used everything yet but the short text, document reader, currency, and color has come in very handy. You know you don’t want to look silly and where mismatch clothes lol.

So I just use the product tab and figured out there was another icon that it would read me more information. The short text doesn’t always read the instructions well for heating but the extra product info gave me all the information I needed. This app matched with my Alexa microwave/oven/air fryer is going to be absolutely marvelous together. Thank you for this app and thank you for continuing to update it.",10/14/21 6:28,2,5

Be My Eyes,"An awesome and useful app! Works great! I encourage anyone who is willing to do some helping, or needs some help, to download and use it. Waited about a month for the first call, but I am glad I could help. Funny fact: the first call came from the visually impaired friend that told me about the app in the first place.

TapTapSee,I like the app. My only complaint is that when I looked at pictures on my phone itgot those The description wrong. The first picture was of me a blind woman holding my son and TapTapSee said it   was a woman holding a girl. My son is a boy! The second picture was of me a blind woman sitting next to my son and it said man in white hoodie next to kid.,04/30/16 3:24,5,3

Seeing AI,"I would recommend this app to anyone who is completely blind, or low vision like me. The best parts of this app for me are it’s ability to read short text on the fly, or capture entire documents in just a few seconds. This app rivals paid apps like DigitEyes and KNFBReader. I can’t speak for KNFBReader as I don’t own that app, but SeeingAI, in my experience, detects products just as good or even better than DigitEyes, as for it’s recognition of text on paper or a computer screen, I’ve not had any complaints about it. Things that need improvement are the money reader, scene recognition, and color recognition. Those features are relatively new, so I expect them to improve with updates. The app gets a five star recommendation from me, for anyone with even a slight visual impairment.",04/20/18 0:45,2;3,5

Be My Eyes,Please be very aware if you were thinking about downloading  this app that they use language which I feel is degrading to blind  people. Also often when you do use the app it just rings and rings for ages and   doesn’t always connect you to anybody. I think there  are better apps that do the same thing and they give you much more control over what is happening. I disagree with the new stories tab as it talks about blind people in language I feel is degrading  such as heartwarming and inspirational. I think this is very infantilising and disrespectful especially as the primary base using this app will be people who want to live their life as independently as possible.,03/23/18 22:35,3,1
Be My Eyes,"I've had this app for a month or so, and I've not been able to help anyone.

Seeing AI,"I just downloaded this app, and so far, I’m really impressed with its functionality. Please keep it going! I’m not blind, nor is my dad, who I actually downloaded it for. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, which causes hallucinations, making it difficult for him to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. He once mentioned that he wished he could point his phone at something and have it tell him whether it was real. That led me to search for apps, and I came across this one.

We plan to use it during his episodes—either he can use his phone himself, or we, as caregivers, can assist him—so he can have confirmation of reality. I’m especially impressed with the describe feature and how detailed it is in explaining what’s being seen. So far, I’m really happy with it. Keep up the great work!",02/05/25 20:00,2,5
TapTapSee,"I was originally looking for a barcode reader, that I could use in conjunction with TalkBack. This works almost as well. When it cannot read the labels of what you are trying to scan, it does its best to describe the item under the camera lens, so that you can determine what you are asking it to see. I really love this app!",11/07/16 0:48,2,5
TapTapSee,"In researching Apps for the visually impaired I came across this app which totally blew me away! It recognized the picture I took as ""burgundy paisley sofa"" well that's about as close a description of my sofa as one could make from a picture! Kudos to the developers. I can see how this app would make a huge difference!!",07/25/13 13:16,2,5
Be My Eyes,"I figured out that you have to align the camera with the object in question. Be my Eyes is very helpful. I recomend this app for blind users who need to know what color things are, what type of food something is, or what a sign says. Be my eyes simply uses kind volinteers to help blind users figure out what they need to know. So, I think Be my eyes is a great app.",03/09/20 7:14,1,5
OneStep Reader,"I would happily pay $99 for the application that I'm looking for, but this is not it. I was hoping that I would be able to use this to read historical SEC filings of companies which include a lot of text and tables. Unfortunately, as their instructional material explains, Advance documents like memos in books are only intended for the cited users, while blind people are only supposed to read receipts. 

Even though it says that you can export to HTML, the only options for saving are PDF and some sort of proprietary format which they recommend for blind people. The only way that you can actually read is by using the audio player tool, as voiceover Will only navigate word by word. You can also only read by sentence, word or line, and not by paragraph. During the OCR process, voiceover will not interact with the application and it does not tell you the progress.

Being able to send the outcome directly to Pages, I can then go on my desktop and format the text and get it ready for the Web. The batch scan feature along with the tremendously  great accuracy and speed, enhance my work flow. The $99.99 seem like a lot but you get what you pay for and then some.

Connecting thru the phone and using the other person’s camera to see is just ingenious. The interaction is straightforward and focused, allowing the blind person an easy way to get assistance with dignity.

It's really cool to point it out the window when I'm in a car or something and it tells me pretty accurately what's out there. Like ""Brown field with green trees"" or ""Black car parked in front of store"". It also is really good with discribing objects. I was in a dentist office and they had decorations all around of wrapped presents. I tryed to get seeing AI to tell me about the boxes but it kept focusing on other things like the chair or the table. But tap tap see said ""Red and white striped box"" which is exactly the information I wanted. I usually use Seeing AI for money and stuff because it's quick, but I use this one for objects because Seeing AI not very good. But, one time, I opened the app and it said something like ""Tap the right side of the screen for pictures and left side for video"". I was interested, and tryed it. But it just took another picture. I tryed it in landscape, but same thing. I even looked it up on the website and it said it could do 10 seconds of video, so I tryed again. Still, just a picture. I tryed doing a video with the Galory and I tryed that. Only pictures showed up. The video thing really got my hopes up but it doesn't work. Maybe something happened because it's not in the app discription. If it wasn't for this, it would be a 5 stars most definitly. But because of this it gets the rating it did. I really think if your going to make something for a visually impaired person, make some better directions or if it's not doing it anymore take those direction of the website. Again, I'm really sorry for this, but I think you shouldn't do that.",12/30/19 12:54,2,3
OneStep Reader,"I am sighted, and was testing this app for recommendation to my 
non-technical blind friend for daily use. Books and newspapers can be 
accessed and read online these days, and she's looking for a tool to help 
with daily tasks such as counting calories, reading signs, and reading 
product instructions and recipe cards. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend 
this app. I tested it on nutrional facts, and they were spoken without any 
pauses at all, making a list of useful data into a confusing stream of 
alternating numbers and words - it skipped one chart almost entirely! I'm 
not sure if the app even read the calorie information, come to think of it. 
I also tested it using a clear picture of the flat back of a cleaning 
spray, and the cautions and instructions were unintelligible, with quite a 
few strings of rarely-used characters such as carets and mathematical 
symbols inserted into the text. I compared the same image of the back of 
the chemical spray using Google translate OCR, and it handled adequately, 
conveying the meaning of the instructions clearly enough to be useful - so 
the legibility of the recognized text is definitely not due to the quality 
of the image. I suspect aerosols would fare more poorly! I do like the 
option to tell you the orientation of the page, but even that could be 
improved by perhaps using a series of bells (low for counterclockwise, high 
for clockwise, and tinkling when centered, for instance) to direct 
orientation instead of relying on a guess-and-check system.",06/20/18 7:55,2,2

Envision AI,I’m a user of seeing ai but I found this app and wanted to check it out because I know a lot of people who use android that would benefit greatly from this app and it’s available on Android unlike seeing ai so I was excited when I found it because I thought finally the visually impaired android users I know can have the same kind of help I get on my iPhone however after getting the app I was sad to see it cost a monthly fee I understand you have to make money and it costs money to make and maintain the app I was just disappointed to see the fee because unlike this app seeing ai is completely free a lot of visually impaired people are on fixed income and may not be able to afford the fee I know one man in particular who could really use this app his vision is almost as bad as mine and I use seeing ai daily but I also know he can’t afford the fee other than that this seems like a great app you all did a great job with it and I thank you for finally making an app like seeing ai that is available for android,04/02/19 21:23,3,3
TapTapSee,"this app continues to amaze me. Don't let the legacy hackerware UI fool you. It's what's under the hood that's bringing information to you that is otherwise not available to you tactually. I'm sort of giving it away, but ... Tap Tap See connected with a series of wearables such as the following would be amazing: spectacles, voice assistant/dictation, gloves, belt, high-latency refreshable braille tiles, low profile bone-conduction.     I'm facetiously scoring Tap Tap See a rating of 4 only because I haven't yet found a way to verify that my clothes match. -) It really deserves an 11.",04/17/16 22:44,4,5

Seeing AI,"I installed this app the day I first heard of it, while listening to the ACB national convention nearly two years ago.  Even though I had had KNFB Reader for a number of years, I mainly added this one for comparison, but soon discovered that it compares favorably with the aforementioned app, as well as with other light-detecting, color-identifying and currency-reading apps I have used over the last five years. I soon realized that I needed to get a newer iPhone in order to use the Products feature—which I did.  I use the app just about every day, for everything from reading mail to reading books, some magazines, and cooking instructions on that packaged dinner I just pulled out of the freezer, and even making sure that coupon I plan to use at a local business hasn’t expired.  The Short Text works especially well, for those times you don’t wish to scan an entire document.  For most things, the Document channel works well, and I like it that the focusing is done automatically.  However, there are occasions when I get the “No text recognized” alert; so then, I revert to KNFB Reader, and sometimes it does a better job reading that document.  I am totally blind from birth; so I am assuming that the documents for which I get that alert are those printed in multiple colors, and with numerous graphics that land smack in the middle of the written text.  I can’t vouch for the color identifier channel—as I have never been able to see color; but, knowing that lighting can affect the way color is perceived—even by a good set of eyes—my take is that any attempt at a color identifier is better than none at all.  The currency reader has improved markedly since the app first came out.  I have been able to read a number of handwritten greeting cards—and other items as well—with the Handwriting channel.  The light detector has saved me any amount of grief, since I have a number of light switches (for overhead lights, of course), which are push-buttons rather than up-and-down toggles; and, we all know people who can’t remember to turn the lights off when they leave.  I’ve had considerable fun with the Scene channel, which is often quite accurate.  I have occasionally had a bit of difficulty getting the bar-code reader (Product channel) to work; but then, bar codes aren’t always in the same location on a box or container.  Just today, I had to search diligently for the bar code on a frozen meal, in order to then read the cooking instructions.  By the time I found and read that information, my battery status had dropped precipitously, from 85 to 60 percent!  If one is using the app for any length of time at a stretch, I suggest that they either have their phone plugged in, or have an external battery handy, as it is a major drain.  On the other hand, this afternoon I was able to read an online menu—which was otherwise totally inaccessible because it was an _image— from a local restaurant.  In this case, SeeingAI did a better job reading it than KNFB Reader!  Finally, to those who insist that there is no currency reader channel, could it be that they are still on an iPhone 5S or earlier?  And to those who insist that the app doesn’t work well with VoiceOver, perhaps they are just new to VoiceOver and need help with it?  This has really been a life-changing app!  I look forward to even more improvements and enhancements, and apologize for the length of this review.",05/26/19 23:28,2,5
OneStep Reader,"I was very excited to try this new app, but am very disappointed. There are a number of problems for a person with low vision:

1)	the icons are not intuitive, and there is no simple legend in the complete manual to show what function each icon performs.
2)	the printed version on the phone is almost, but not quite, large enough for me to read. My vision is approximately 20/100 and the large font on my iPhone allows me to read e-mails and texts easily. Ironically, this app doesn’t even allow for the same large fonts available in these basic iPhone functions.
3)	The first images I took resulted in a text translation that was imply jibberish. I took a picture of a book page, but the text on the screen, and the read aloud translation made no sense. 

An app like this is sorely needed for people who simply have low vision, but aren’t completely blind. I sincerely hope that there will be improvements for those of us who can almost function, but not quite, without adaptive technology.",10/01/14 12:12,3,1

It feels great to know that I’m helping someone improve the quality of their life just by answering the phone! 

I really hope more visually impaired people discover this app and that the use of it makes life easier and safer for them. 

This is the best app ever created. Every app that I’ve ever used is completely for my own benefit. I think it’s absolutely genius how the creators of this app found a way to get people to volunteer in a way that is so easy and convenient. 

I can’t believe Google or Apple, etc. didn’t come up with this sooner.",01/07/18 20:01,1,5

I had a resident at my facility that slowly lost his sight; and we were shocked to find out there wasn’t many programs/assistive devices accessible through Medicare or our area. I just happened to be researching through ideas when I came across this app. Decided not only would I donate a phone to him, so management could get him on the app. (My heart, and just me in general being empathetic, couldn’t bare to see him so lost in his environment). I also decided to volunteer, and I just had my first phone call. I literally got excited that the app was ringing, but also it was an overall great interaction. 💛💛 This app is a 10/10, hands down.",10/27/22 22:45,1,5

Be My Eyes,"This is such a wonderful app, I learned about it today and signed up immediately. Within 3 minutes I received a call from someone who needed to know what medication they were holding. We take our vision for granted sometimes, and forget how difficult simple tasks can be for the blind. It only takes a few minutes out of your day to help someone read a label or instructions and think of how positively that impacted them.

lifted my spirits tremendously. I suffer from Chronic Lyme Disease and am 
no longer able to work, volunteer, or even leave the house much. This is a 
wonderful opportunity for me to feel useful again. I have become aware of 
so many horrible things about our world and been so let down by so many 
things I had such faith in before. My search for answers to my health 
problems has opened my eyes to how truly disgusting human beings can be. 
Discovering this app has restored a bit of hope in me today. I really 
needed it. So, THANK YOU!! From the bottom of my heart to all who had a 
hand in creating this, thank you! You are not only helping the blind to 
see, you are helping all of us to see more kindness which is very much 
needed in today's world! ❤ **I also wanted to add that you are able to Sign 
In & Sign Out of the app as a way to show when you are available or not. I 
am not sure if this is new but I noticed that others had suggested that 
they wished there was a way to put hours of availability in so they 
wouldn't miss any calls. If anyone is hesitating because of this, it seems 
they have already come up with a solution. 😉 BRAVO! MAKERS OF BE MY EYES!

It can read labels on cans and other products and tell you what they are. He can tell you the ingredients. It can read the text in books, type written and handwritten",08/25/22 23:29,2,5

TapTapSee,"I think this is a pretty good app for a blind user to have to use for a lot of identification. I've used this app when it first came out or at least since I first heard about it back in 2012 on my iPhone 4s, I was much impressed at to what I heard and now I feel the app has much improved. In fact, the other day, I laid some hand towels out on my bathroom vanity and had the lights on, I needed to know the colors to sort them, since I already knew the colors of towels I had, but not knowing which one was which, I took several pictures with tap tap see and each item was correctly described  of it's color, I managed to even get a pic of myself  of my shirt I was wearing at the time, tap tap see woman wearing a white shirt,that was right too. I've used it in recognizing some items in my pantry as well. It's a good useful app for me, I am very glad it's still available, I had purchased the 100 picture pack, of course I am very glad to have the pictures free, but it would be worth it to me to pay again if that was necessary.",05/19/17 20:20,2,5

Seeing AI,uninstalling because Image descriptions are less than 10% accurate. They often show what is not in the image and miss details present in the image.

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"The app gives excellent, audible feedback, so that blind people can know what the traffic signal is doing even when there is no traffic. I have used it with a variety of intersections, and I have found it to be accurate. The only mistake it has made is to not give any feedback, even when it should have. However, after reporting this to the developers, the problem was solved in just a day or two.

OneStep Reader,"This is one of the best reading apps out there.  I've seen it work well for many of my blind/visually impaired friends.  However, it's a bit tricky to use if you have truble with your hands shaking or moving.   I hope that in future updates, this could be worked on.  
I've personally had a hard time getting all four edges of the document to line up with the camra.   Using the field view report thing is also a bit tricky, like someone else pointed out. 
I do like the fact that it allows those with reading disibilities to gain independence as far as being able to read documents and other printed items.
I also hope in future updates, we could be able to use the ALEX voice to read our documents (For those who have ALEX on their devices).  I'm not a huge fan of Samantha, personally.",12/26/14 13:32,2;4,4

Be My Eyes,"I am blind, and I do ask for help sometimes. Sometimes it's basic things, like reading labels, reading paper, etc at times, I ask for help reading my computer screen or a piece of technology allowed to me, so I can figure out how to diagnose the issue.

I have been noticing that when I called into be my eyes, some people I talk to have been rude towards me. Happens a lot when I ask someone to repeat information to me again to make sure that I heard things right, and when I ask for help navigating my computer screen and they know nothing about technology, as such, they get frustrated with me. One time, it was because I need to flip a switch on an electrical outlet and I could not feel that switch very well, the person I called asked me to call an electrician instead. However, sometimes it does happen that you make friends on the be my eyes app.

There are a few more things that I wish to be added in to this app. It would be cool if volunteers could help you take photos, and the photos they take can automatically be added into your library. Although I am not a volunteer, an I don't know how volunteers use this app, but I think it would be cool if they had the option to zoom in and pan around. I think that would be helpful to volunteers who have trouble reading extremely small text.

Be my eyes is a great place to ask for help when you need it. The thing is, is that you still, sometimes, have to try multiple times when you call. Furthermore, You still need to be careful because at times, you make it someone who is rude. But if you're willing to deal with that, it's still a good app to consider downloading for smaller, non-technical and non-private things.",07/02/20 15:08,2;3,4

He wasn’t born blind, he’s losing it slowly and he needed someone to talk to as he didn’t get the job he applied for today due to his condition. He’s here on a student visa in NC and was hitting rock bottom tonight, alone with no family around. What are the odds that me, sitting here with a broken arm feeling sorry for myself would get that call? I’ll heal in 6-12 weeks and he’ll never see again. I talked to him about all the wonderful things he has yet to smell, touch, hear, taste and feel, that he has a good life ahead of him. That he’s not alone, I met a new friend named Shehryar. I needed this tonight

Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer the reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the volunteer to impaired ratio is drastically skewed. There are WAY more visually impaired people who need help this app needs to market to them and advertise more so more visually impaired people sign up. This app sound also alert the impaired that there are 4million volunteers and to please call any second of their day they need help. There are so many of us eager to help I don’t feel like the app does a good enough job in marketing to really impact the visually impaired with out knowledge or whom feel like they are over using the app bc they are not sooo many of us get a call 1-2 time a year they could be calling way more or have way more people signing up to use the app (visually impaired) if they had a more aggressive marketing strategy.,10/23/20 6:40,1,4

And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I’m having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can’t want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me.",09/19/18 14:26,2,5

Be My Eyes,"This app is amazing as-is! As a sighted person, I have a few thoughts to really take this app to the next level of helping people with visual impairments (and possibly other disabilities). 

Many people prefer something simplistic like this app. However, I could see a companion app being made with an entire social network. 
-- People could friend each other so they can re-request help from the same people. 
-- When a disabled person gets excellent assistance, the helper could receive a rating of some kind (and high quality ratings could lead to more calls for help). It would also be nice if a blind person could show appreciation by sending free e-gifts or even real gift cards. Most people just aim to be helpful and don't expect anything in return, but when someone does something above and beyond to help me with my physical disability, I feel that it's important to show my gratitude somehow so I won't feel like I'm taking advantage of others time and efforts. You could also make it possible to earn mPoints where helping someone will earn points, and high ratings and being given e-gifts will earn a boatload of mPoints as a reward, which can then be traded for free gift cards or prizes. (I'm certain mPoints would work with you to make this happen!) 
-- Sighted people could turn their availability on or off so they won't be disturbed at a bad time. 
-- Sighted people could use hashtags and write detailed profiles that indicate their special skills (i.e. I'm a higher ed mentor/tutor and teacher who could assist with homework help, I could list my computer and tech proficiencies, I could list the languages I speak, my fashion sense, my experience with children, my age, etc.), and then disabled people could search for people with particular skills (and have the profile read to them to get more information) to get the best possible help. 
-- If immediate help isn't available, there could be a public Twitter-like stream where requests for help can be posted with video and/or photo and written description. Any addressed issues that are helped in this manner would be marked as helped so a disabled person isn't bombarded with answers. Additionally, friends could post requests on each other's wall that will be seen when their friend becomes available again. 

This is just some possibilities that could be made available with a more social network-like app. I still think this simplistic app is best for many people, but others could surely benefit from a second app with the added features of a network. Please work on developing this!

Also, open up community beta testing via TestFlight! I have 19 years experience with testing hardware/software and would love to help ensure that the app remains bug-free and 100% usable by the people who rely on it most!",05/12/16 4:10,4,5

Would be great to have more features in the future to interact with the other person in the call, like maps (One time a guy needed guidance to go to a bus station and I found it hard to help as I didn't know where we where) or a chat box to send links (Another guy needed some help with setting a screen reader in his phone and details to contact 'La Once' (National Organization of Spanish blind people) 😊",05/22/21 4:00,1;3,5

I feel there are more people that want to help than blind people that know it’s an option, or at the least someone on the other end wants to help. I helped an American woman that was at the laundromat at 5am. Me being in the UK meant I was awake and able to help her. We had a lovely chat too. I actually wish there were more sight impaired people using it because there are so many sighted people ready and willing to help.

Seeing AI,I am not blind or poorly sighted but just working on a home project and was testing out different ai. This one absolutely blew me away and is of excellent use and is very very well designed and programmed. I give tremendous credit to this programming team.,07/05/19 4:10,1,5
Be My Eyes,"What a brilliant idea. This app works very well and leaves me feeling good after every use (I'm a sighted helper), knowing I at least tried to help (it doesn't always work out quite as one might hope, but that's not the app's fault). My kudos and thanks to the developers.

Oh – I hadn't opened the latest version of the app before I wrote that. I'm disappointed to see that the points system and my stats are gone now. Neither can I any longer attach a photo to my profile (though I suppose if the only people who would encounter it are blind, it is really kind of pointless).

So now my jury is a little more out on the app. I'll have to see how it works in actual use now before I can really say more about it.",05/30/17 23:54,3;4,4
Be My Eyes,"I haven't used it yet but I will and I think this is fantastic. I read a few reviews about people not recieving calls for months. I'm leaving this review to see how far you guys have gone on advertising this app directly to the ones who actually need it. Hospitals, retirement homes, homes for the blind should be places to target to expand the audience and customer's in need or people who want to help. A lot of people can get it for their love ones. Keep up the good work though.",07/06/19 10:25,2,5
Seeing AI,Love this app. I lost my vision three years ago and was told that this app is very useful. I use it almost daily on the go in at home. Everything works pretty seamless except for the color reader which can be kind of an accurate at times. It would be amazing if you guys can add some thing that would be able to read digital clocks. Unfortunately a lot of my devices in my home have digital clocks like my stove my washing machine my thermostat etc. I do use a lot of smart devices in my home but some of them are not able to be hooked up to my smart devices. So it would be pretty cool if I could hold the phone in front of the stove to see what temperature the oven is on or how much time is left on the washing machine etc. Overall absolutely love this application.

Seeing AI,"I am not blind (and thank goodness), merely have failing sight.  But I cannot imagine being completely sightless and being able to utilize this app for anything.

After using this app for several months, I realised that many of users used it for other purposes. So far I received four calls from different users, I can tell all of them are not blind because they asked silly questions about things they know all the details about.
Do not risk your privacy and don’t waste your time by using this fake app. I’m not against helping people in need, but this app is a joke. Try to find another ways to help people without risking your privacy.",12/09/20 21:20,6,1

OneStep Reader,"The fact that such an app exists at all to help those of us who can’t see well enough to read print is worthy of three stars, so I am grateful we have this tool. That said, this behaves more like a free app than one I spent $100 on. First of all, where are the updates??? We are coughing up the money, so you should be providing frequent updates. My biggest issue with the app is trying to line up the shot when scanning a document. The phone vibrates wildly, which I gather is supposed to indicate whether or not it is being held at a level angle over the page, but I find this almost impossible to get just right and more annoying than helpful. Can’t alignment of the page be done electronically during image processing? Secondly, I wish it behaved like banking apps when you are taking a picture of a check for an electronic deposit. You simply hold the phone over the document and move it around a bit until it is lined up. Once it is aligned, the app automatically takes the picture for you and processing begins. For $100, why isn’t this app doing the same? The technology obviously exists. Instead, it is a tedious game of guess-and-check where I have to continuously press one of the volume buttons to get a status update on whether or not I am lined up. Even The motion of reaching to press this button makes it harder to steady the phone, so I never feel like I get a really good shot. These announcements should happen automatically. Finally, the documents generated, while often producing some readable text, usually also have a mess of garbled text and random symbols, making it very hard to find what you are looking for. I know the technology exists nowadays for OCR processing to work much more smoothly than this, and again, at the price you are asking, your app needs to be a lot better. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t have purchased this app and would have just settled for something free that basically gets the job done comparably well.  Many blind and visually impaired people are on fixed incomes, so taking a chance on something like this with no option of getting your money back is a big deal.",04/14/18 10:29,2,3

Seeing AI,This app is awesome and I as a totally blind person can appreciate what Microsoft is doing. But it is a battery killer. Still I was able to read a few weeks worth of mail and was able to reapply us to something that I had not even known we were removed from so good job Microsoft but there is definitely room for improvement.,07/12/17 19:10,1;2;3,3
Be My Eyes,Really wonderful and hands off to your ideas to help the blind,02/11/18 22:46,1,5
Be My Eyes,I have read a pill bottle and an oven setting and both made this empty nester feel like a million dollars. The challenge is to verbally coach the blind person to align the phone with the object so it can be seen! It helps so much for either the camera or the object to be stationary so that the coaching is for only one item. I am a quiet person and this gives me an opportunity to help people in short bursts. Brilliant app!,10/22/22 13:05,1,5

Be My Eyes,"You'll never regret using this app to help someone! It is the most amazing feeling to be able to see for someone who has impaired vision. Please, help someone else today - it will help you, too!!! 🥰 For people who say that the answer button is unresponsive: A few people I know think that this is most likely due to others trying to answer that same call, at the same time ...

Be My Eyes,"I see a lot of reviews from people saying that they haven't gotten any calls. My mother has been completely blind her entire life and she knows better than anyone that technology for the visually impaired is years behind what it should be. I'm predicting it will take the blind community time to even become aware that this app exists. What I can say for sure is that my mom is extremely grateful for an app like this. She actually has facetimed me in the past to ask me what color shirt would look best with her outfit, or to have me read a soup can label, and so on. Blind people NEED apps like this, and you don't know how much you'll be helping by downloading this app. It only takes a minute out of your day to make a huge difference in someone's life. So, I encourage you to keep the app if you can spare the storage space instead of getting discouraged and deleting it.",03/19/15 19:11,1,5

Seeing AI,"the updates keep getting better, from the jumping text, they fixed it, to the document channel being sluggish and now that's fixed. microsoft is doing an excellent job and no account needed and this all free. love it. my one thing is I would love the seen preview and where you share photos from the share sheet to have a way to interact with the AI like you can now in the document channel. these guys brought much more rich descriptions to the seen and share sheets, but theres no interactions with it, if you could ask it followup you would have a 5 star app I think. edit, you can now ask seeingAI questions about your photo, this is fantastic.   I have no problem recommending this app and the other thing i'll say is working with microsoft's seeingAI staff via email you get quick responces. I do not work with them but what I mean is like emailing them, their turnaround time has ben rather snappy I feel. they seem to really get blind people with their seeingAI here and its just getting better.edit, as of Version 5.5, the interface is much more streamlined, I didn't think it possible to make it any easier but they did, and they blended a few channels into one, like the read tab is short text and document all in one and you also have the option to toggle with a button with document alignment and you can even take a photo in that tab. theres so much more they did and its just excellent and we still get access to the older stuff. I love the describe tab updates, now you get a rich description right out of the gate when you snap a photo or load one. its excellent thank you so much Microsoft and team over at seeing AI.",02/08/25 8:05,1,5

It is not continuing from where left, always I should remember the page I left and go-to the related page , very annoying. Otherwise this app does what is expected.

But you don’t have to. It’s just a suggestion.

Cash Reader for the Blind,"I downloaded the app, gave access to my camera, pointed my camera at the bill, and all I saw was what I normally would say if I were taking a picture of something. I can’t believe they charge for this app. I’m glad I tried out the free version first.

Seeing AI,"Hello I am blind and I use the Seeing AI app. It works. My only complaint is that we can’t wear a camera or and it is in progress to use the world setting for indoor use only at the moment it would make sense to me that person could make maybe glasses that you could wear with the success of the Seeing AI app in them or you could hold your phone up and it could describe the world around you, and if it could get good enough at this, you could walk around and be told some of how to get around you were still use your cane with the other hand, it also might be good if you had a FaceTime option and you had a live person that could come through and see what you’re looking at on the phone when your loan so they can describe things for you should be another good option for them to add and how come, they’re not helping the blind get those cars that I should do drive we’re supposed to be helping the disabled I approve of the Seeing AI app if you could get the cameras in glasses and have that app and maybe a FaceTime person person with ice blind could possibly navigate streets they would still want to pay attention with their cane",12/30/23 2:32,3,5

TapTapSee,"I cannot emphasize enough what an amazing app this is! It works perfectly. I tried it with many different objects, and it recognized all of them. Truly a marvel for blind people. Comes in handy tremendously. However, I am not fond of having to purchase picture packages in order to have continual use of the product. I feel a flat rate would be a much more efficient Way to be charged. I'd pay $5-$10 for this app but don't think I should have a continual charge from month to month or as a pay as you go status. Again, wonderful app… Totally perfect! Hope you decide to make a paid version",01/13/14 20:47,1;3,4

It was such a heartwarming moment I got to assist with: helping to spell out letters in a book for a young girl and her sight impaired father. I can just imagine how needed a service like this would be for seemingly simple moments in a sight impaired life. As long as I have it, I will gladly use my sight to assist people, just as I hope others will help me if mine goes. Thank you to the creators for such a thoughtful app.",05/02/19 23:53,2,5

Seeing AI,"This app beats the KNFB reader hands down. With KNFB reader you have to constantly be hitting that field of view report button to get the relative position. Seeing AI lets me leave the document I'm scanning in one place while I adjust the camera angle. Once all four corners of the page are in the camera lens, it takes the picture and eliminates guesswork.

Be My Eyes,"I absolutely love this app. The ability to help a total stranger in need is so very rewarding. I love to help people and this gives the opportunity to do so. There are more volunteers than blind so it can take a while to get a call but, when you do get a call it’s worth the wait!",09/08/22 23:08,1,5
Be My Eyes,I hope this app is advertised to schools for blind and as widely as possible. I got my first call yesterday and it went really well! A married couple who are both visually impaired needed my help reading some insurance cards. They were so impressed by the app service and we chatted a little bit after. This app is a great idea! Please market this great service!,12/13/18 17:57,2,5
Be My Eyes,I am writing this after more than six months of using it. Earlier there were bugs & glitches in the app but now the functionality & quality has improved by leaps & bounds. It is great to help someone in need of assistance & I have assisted over 40 people till date & today I addressed a meeting of principles of blind persons colleges in New Delhi over the app. They throughly tested the app & were super impressed by its privacy & functional features.,09/26/23 1:45,1,5
OneStep Reader,It doesn't seem to work unless you pay $100! I'm severely visually impaired and the app doesn't seem to work and if so it's so confusing I can't seem to get it to work. Nor do I have $100 to put towards an app. Definitely uninstalling.,08/04/23 11:36,3,1

Seeing AI,"This app is literally a dream come true for not only people who are blind or low vision but also for the profoundly dyslexic or otherwise print disabled people. My son is profoundly dyslexic and despite being 14 years old his ability to read print with his eyes is less than a first grade equivalent.  We have tried and use many apps and other technologies to help him access the world of print. Despite his struggles, he is a voracious consumer of audiobooks and this app allows him to access print around the environment with so much less effort than other apps. It also has very good accuracy. I also think the facial expression recognition feature has potential to assist people with Autism. Frankly, this app is just plain wonderful!!!!",11/14/19 1:36,1,5

It’s just a great app, fantastic idea!",09/11/20 4:17,1,5

Seeing AI,"I just downloaded this app, and so far, I’m really impressed with its functionality. Please keep it going! I’m not blind, nor is my dad, who I actually downloaded it for. He was diagnosed with Lewy Body dementia, which causes hallucinations, making it difficult for him to distinguish between what’s real and what’s not. He once mentioned that he wished he could point his phone at something and have it tell him whether it was real. That led me to search for apps, and I came across this one.

We plan to use it during his episodes—either he can use his phone himself, or we, as caregivers, can assist him—so he can have confirmation of reality. I’m especially impressed with the describe feature and how detailed it is in explaining what’s being seen. So far, I’m really happy with it. Keep up the great work!",02/05/25 12:00,2,5

Be My Eyes,I am visually impaired but it’s not bad enough for me to need this app. I downloaded it just to have a look and I saw that there was no other way to ‘see’ things apart from calling. Obviously this is a good idea but my friend who is severely vi doesn’t like attention regarding her vision so if there was a thing where it answered simple questions like colours or dates like the images it would be even better than I have seen.,01/19/20 8:06,1,5

This app helps me a lot with telling me what I have in the pantry and then I go take a picture of things in the store and it will tell me with voiceover and I can either get that item if it’s the right thing I want or not. Also, it helps me with knowing if it’s a one dollar bill or a five dollar bill or anything like that. And it is also good for taking pictures of electronics.

Be My Eyes,"I signed up 8 or 9 months ago as a way to try and help make a difference in someone's life even if it's a small one like picking the right food up at the grocery store. I wish I could tell you how great this app is and how fulfilled I feel after helping someone but sadly I cannot. There is no way to email or report issues or bugs so now I'm left writing a bad review after another unsuccessful connection. The app never works, it crashes on almost every call. I've tried connecting to 9 people in 9 months and only 1 of those was what the blind would call successful. It was a poor connection and very grainy, it was very difficult to hear exactly what was being asked. But being the 1st time I figured it could only get better from there, but sadly I was mistaken. I have this love hate relationship with this app where every time it goes off I get a smile on my face knowing someone needs my help only to be disappointed time and time again when it doesn't work properly. The other reviews are clearly from people that work on the app and not actual users like I am otherwise you would hear more of the same.

Be My Eyes,Amazing app. Feel good to help blind people's.,05/09/18 9:27,1,5
Seeing AI,"Pro’s -
• Does what it says, how it says without glitches or ads.
• Doesn’t try to profit off the disability of others, giving us what comes free to others.
Con’s -
• People Recognition has to be done by taking their picture & many refuse to allow that. It would be easier if it can be done by a previously taken photo. This way permission isn’t needed to know who is around you!
• Vague description on objects & animals. Would love to know if it’s my dachshund or Chihuahua eating or just came in, I already know both are dogs!
Tips -
• To be a navigational assistance as well can erase the need of multiple apps & can be the one stop shop for the blind!
• Adding the option to use previous taken photos to recognize those around us.
I have been blind 6yrs & have used this app for 4 of them years. Sometimes I forget I’m blind due to this app! I recommend it on every device with a blind operator!",01/14/21 1:12,3,4

Be My Eyes,"The app is good with the really ironic exception that it is not designed with an accessible interface!? There is no dark mode, and lots of the text is really small and low contrast. Reading white on black is often much easier for visually impaired people, so please test it with us! This app has the potential to be really helpful, but it bugs me that they haven't considered the way VI users will interact with it",05/30/23 2:51,3,3

BlindSquare,Great. Does exactly what it says it will do. Fully accessible. Easy to use and integrates well into other navigation systems. Give you a good sense of what's around you and guide to you to a destination using the clockface. Clearly is a mainstream application as well. Might do with either another version or renaming the product. Fantastic! Make it more attractive to people who are not blind and I think it's a real winner.,10/10/12 23:31,1,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"UPDATE: This is sadly no longer a usable app for me, now that navigation features have been added that prevent me from using it as a pedestrian crosswalk signal. Now when the app opens it is in a map view prompting you to enter a destination. It WILL NOT FUNCTION AS A PEDESTRIAN SIGNAL until you activate that feature. If you are a low vision user, it’s not prominent or obvious. If you are a VoiceOver user, good luck trying to get there while at a noisy intersection. I can’t open the app in advance because it drains battery really fast.

I previously had given this app a 5 star review. The developers had solicited the review, but it was an honest one. I’ll leave it below for reference of how great the app used to be, and I’m still giving it 2 stars in the hopes that it might become usable again someday.

PREVIOUS REVIEW: 
More reliable and easy to use than an APS. I’ve been so impressed with this app! It’s so easy to use even when the environment is too loud to hear VoiceOver speech — I can just say “Hey Siri, open OKO” and it immediately jumps into action with haptics and sounds giving me my own accessible pedestrian signal. I love the haptics because I can still get the crosswalk signal information while simultaneously focusing on the traffic sounds. It also saves me time because (1) I can get the visible pedestrian signal status as I’m approaching the intersection and (2) if I want to cross kitty corner and don’t have the walk signal in front of me I can quickly turn my phone to check if I already have the walk signal to cross in  the other direction. It has given me a lot more confidence and independence navigating my city after vision loss and makes crossing the street much more analogous to how I could when I was fully-sighted.",06/11/24 3:23,3,2
BlindSquare,"Thank you very much from the bottom of my beating heart: this app makes me more social, now I can do anything by myself, I can go whatever I want to go, I don't need to call my friends and asking them about the directions, really it's very very very important for every blind in this world, specially with supporting different languages ☺️👍👍",10/28/14 3:48,1,5
Be My Eyes,"This app is really cool. It's always good to use technology for helping others. Below are some suggestions from me (not sure if y'all already implemented it or not): 1. Rating system of the helpers. The goal is just to avoid crazy ppl trying to trap or do any non beneficial things to the blind people. 2. Maybe the app can also connect blind people to their nearest people around them. That way, if they need a direction, someone nearby can easily help navigating it.",04/08/19 17:26,4,5
Be My Eyes,"If he is blind, how did he got the app ?",10/20/19 2:37,-1,4
Be My Eyes,"I’m a volunteer on the app and have only had a handful of calls in the past few months since I downloaded it. That makes sense, there’s almost 11 times as many volunteers willing to help than blind on the app. The world can be so ugly that those numbers alone are a beautiful thing.

The app is very easy to use as a seeing person. And I’m so grateful that it’s a free resource for whoever needs it.

To developers, for your consideration: the blind are not the only people who are visually impaired. This app could be used by people with schizophrenia or even drug-induced hallucinations to determine if what they’re seeing or hearing can be confirmed by a third party.

Very cool! Thanks for prioritizing humanity over profits, I’m honored to participate!",02/21/25 23:57,1,5

Be My Eyes,"This app, along with Seeing AI, are by far the most valuable apps for the blind. Most useful of course, is the Be My AI tab on this app. As a blind person, this has provided me magnitudes more independence than anything else. The ability to know what I am looking at, has brought me so much freedom and inclusion that I cannot describe. I must point out a glaring shortcoming.The problem is that the app, in an effort to protect privacy, has not taken into account that if a blind person is asking something to be described, a sighted person could easily see this info. The app refuses to describe certain things and immediately suggests that I call a volunteer. We know we can call a volunteer, stop suggesting it at the end of EVERY response. I am blind and need to provide my credit card number to pay a bill or to see if the card is expired. The app will not give me any info for privacy reasons. It tells me to call a volunteer. Why would I allow a stranger to see my credit card? It would be more secure to have AI read it to me! Also describing people is invaluable to a blind person, and it refuses to give information on a persons appearance. how does it violate privacy when a sighted person can see the same person?
Also, I do not want to give a rating whether I had a good chat or not every single time. Overall, I like the app a lot, but need it to be more forthcoming in its responses.",07/23/24 22:02,2;6,5

Be My Eyes,"Although there are a few small tweaks that could make this app better, overall this is a great app. This app is all about helping others that are visually impaired. There are no ads, it's free. It's just to help others. It has a small footprint on your phone and runs unnoticed until someone needs help. Give it a try and be the eyes for someone. I have it on my phone so I know that it works without hurting or slowing down your phone.",08/09/19 12:01,1,5

Be My Eyes,Amazing initiative. You guys need to get more visually impaired guys on to the App.,01/12/20 17:59,1,5
Seeing AI,This app shows that Microsoft is really working hard towards changing its culture and bringing more empathy among themselves. The products like Seeing AI is a step in right direction to show the world the power of AI and how it can play a positive role in human lives and in this case it can really help visually impaired people to be independent. Great job!!,10/20/17 13:46,1,5
Be My Eyes,This is the good application for blindness people if they need assistance I will totally recommend this app,07/01/19 23:56,1,5
Be My Eyes,"24 hours ago I signed up to volunteer. My sister is blind and has been for about 10 years. She uses this app when she goes to the grocery store and has found that everyone who volunteers to take her call for help, have been extremely nice and friendly. 
As she says, for someone with sight, it doesn’t seem like much to help someone who is blind. But for someone who is blind, it means the world to them.

Thank you for creating this amazing app!",05/25/19 23:42,1,5

Being blind this app is a life saver!

NaviLens,"Neosistec, in a review on here you replied to user Philip Pearn saying ""NaviLens is for blind users"". This contradicts the NaviLens About page which states ""This makes them useful for *blind ""and"" low vision people*. All you need to do is to point the camera of the device to a tag in order to quickly read its contents. So who is wrong? you or the information on the app About page?",10/02/22 5:15,2,2

Be My Eyes,"Took 8 months to finally get a call but worth it. I helped an elderly lady read the directions on a packet of jello mix. Those 30 seconds made my day. I wish i got calls more often but there are 5 million sighted people ready to help only 300k visually impaired people haha, so no wonder it took 8 months for me to be picked by the app to answer a call",10/20/21 11:15,2,5
Be My Eyes,"I’m a volunteer here and I have answered a call before. It is super rewarding and I absolutely love it. The only downside is that in the few months I’ve had the app, I’ve only received three calls. The call goes out to several volunteers so you gotta be quick but you know that if you can’t answer, someone will. I love this and encourage all impaired people to download this app and use it and I urge all sighted people to download and become a volunteer.",09/08/18 2:18,1,5

Seeing AI,"Hello I am blind and I use the Seeing AI app. It works. My only complaint is that we can’t wear a camera or and it is in progress to use the world setting for indoor use only at the moment it would make sense to me that person could make maybe glasses that you could wear with the success of the Seeing AI app in them or you could hold your phone up and it could describe the world around you, and if it could get good enough at this, you could walk around and be told some of how to get around you were still use your cane with the other hand, it also might be good if you had a FaceTime option and you had a live person that could come through and see what you’re looking at on the phone when your loan so they can describe things for you should be another good option for them to add and how come, they’re not helping the blind get those cars that I should do drive we’re supposed to be helping the disabled I approve of the Seeing AI app if you could get the cameras in glasses and have that app and maybe a FaceTime person person with ice blind could possibly navigate streets they would still want to pay attention with their cane",12/29/23 18:32,3;4,5

OneStep Reader,yes would recommend the application. the application helps the blind . its a great  application for OCR with a smart mobile device. this is a really handy application when you don't have a flatbed scanner  handy or around like in a hotel or at a cconference or meeting. in which you need to  scan important documents and read  them an then have a discussion on that particular topic.,10/30/15 21:01,1;2,5

OneStep Reader,"Being blind and having a great item in my arsenal of adaptive technology is not only useful,it is a must. I strongly recommend this for anyone who has a visual disability.

TapTapSee,"I have never written a review before, but I have a strong urge to enhance this app for my Deafblind community, including myself. I do love the simplicity of its design and its grayish icon of an eye. I strongly suggest that it should have an accessible version for Deafblind (DB)— they would appreciate reading descriptions and converted text so that they won't feel inhibited in their access to visual information around them. Another suggestion is I don't know what limitations an iPhone 5 has, but it would be incredible to know the sound information around them, such as the ""inaudible"", ""music playing"", ""chatting"" and so on. Siri is able to recognize sounds and therefore, it should have a technology to detect sounds. In addition, it should include three different modes: Braille/Sizable text, Sound, and both that they can switch seamlessly. I will restore my 5 star rating when it's accessible for DB.  :'(",05/21/13 20:45,3,1

This may sound minor, but for someone who is blind and has trouble with small tasks that require vision, it is absolutely unbelievable! Others have given it lower ratings for some minor problems, and I won't deny that they exist. But the app really works, and it is so ingenious that all of those little things, that don't really matter anyway, are completely overshadowed!

Seeing AI,"Thanks to Microsoft! This is something which I have dreamed about for years. I am particularly impressed with the facial recognition feature. If Microsoft continues research in this direction, then I will be a regular customer of Microsoft. As one who is visually impaired, I am eternally grateful to Microsoft.",07/12/17 18:47,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"As a young person who recently lost their vision this all makes so much of a difference. It helps me to be less reliant on my loved ones and helps me be more independent. Also helps with the frustration when nobody was available and I was stuck and the reality of my condition really set in but now with this app all of those “minor” bumps along the way are gone. It may seem insignificant but it’s the pile up of all of those “small” things that makes life seem like too much to handle so thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing this. 
God bless

Be My Eyes,"I read about Be My Eyes in an article one day early into the pandemic. I installed the app in 2020 and have since answered 15 or so calls.  

I like the ux design, it’s no bells and whistles and works reliably. I’ve never been dropped from a call and the camera works reliably enough for me to read small text. 

Every one of the calls I’ve answered has been with kind people. I happily drop whatever I’m doing to answer when I see a call come through because there’s an uplifting sense of usefulness when a call comes in and you can help someone simply by having vision and being willing to share it for a couple of minutes. That to me is the beauty of technology. I’d love to see more apps like this one.",08/08/22 4:23,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I love this app so much I love helping others and volunteering in my community. This app is nothing short of volunteering & helping out not just the permanently blind, but temporarily blind, and people who are experiencing vision loss either in one or both eyes….but will eventually lead to permanent vision loss.
   I also have helped some people who are extremely dyslexic, which thank God my mother experiences, extreme cases of dyslexia, and also people who are colorblind, (I didn’t even think to what extent color blindness can  affect’s one’s entire vision in the long run). I’ve never had a problem when it comes to anybody being disrespectful or coming off creepy or anything of the sort. I’ve been very lucky to answer calls for people who are very much in need, and are very grateful, very helpful throughout the process and are just amazing people. Thank you for making this up. It does help me as much as it helps. Other people who cannot get around on a day-to-day basis due to a disability and I hope to continue to help and speak with others as often as the calls come in. ❤️",10/04/22 4:00,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"There needs to be more guidance apps like this to help disabled people. If you're visually impaired, there are people ready to help. In my opinion people should be vetted before volunteering just to prevent abuse. But that's my only concern. For those not getting any calls, it took me 3 months, its normal as theres millions of helpers and only hundreds of thousands impaired people",08/21/19 17:42,4,4
Be My Eyes,This is a great app. Very easy to use and so rewarding for both the volunteer and the blind person needing a little help. Just takes a quick moment to use. Only downside is that there are not enough calls and they are hard to get. This is due to difference in # of volunteers and blind people. We need to encourage more people to sign up!,12/31/21 2:17,1;3,5

I got first call after 15 days of signing up as a volunteer and I still remember it was to help a person with some documents! I felt so good after that! And we are still in touch. Now if that person needs any help with the documents and text reading they directly connect with me. This app is really helpful for visually impaired people who need help with daily tasks.

Seeing AI,"Hello:

I am a totally blind person who thoroughly enjoys using the Seeing AI app. Just a quick note to let you know that I absolutely love the Seeing AI app. I absolutely love it's many features, and it is truly a life-changing app. I use the short text feature when I want to find out who may have sent me mail, or if I want to find out something about a flyer or something like that. I also really enjoy using the product feature where I can read information about everything from bags of skittles to chips and other things such as canned goods. Your app as all the other readers of it's type completely beaten. Once again, I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work. I'm a fan for life.",08/15/17 0:56,1;2;4,5
Envision AI,"The Envision app is definately by far the best app for the blind and visually impaired on the market today. It far surpasses all of the other apps for android due to the fact that it is so easy to use, and gives you auditory guidance when lining up the text for reading and so on. As a user of the app myself, I have come to realize just how useful it can really be in so many situations. At the time of this writing, I am on the free trial version of the app, but I can definitely tell you that this app will bring a level of independence that no other app on the market can bring you. For one thing, the accuracy of the scanning of the text is far superior than any other app. The folks at Envision have really thought of everything! Being blind or visually impaired doesn't have to be a prison any longer. Technology has come to the rescue with Envision, a brand new innovation in wearable and handheld technology that uses artificial intelligence to help the blind and visually impaired to navigate in a sighted world. Now for the first time in history, artificial intelligence is able to help the blind and visually impaired get more information from a sighted world by implementing the reading of text based information in real time, or by taking photos and relaying the information through optical character recognition technology that is second to none in the industry. Not only this, but Envision technology can do so much more. You can use it to describe your surroundings, tell you what color something is, identify faces and even read bar codes and identify certain objects. This means that Envision AI technology can actually learn thus making it the one and only technology for the blind and visually impaired that is fully customizable for each person's individual needs. You see, more and more companies are jumping onto the bandwagon by creating their own wearables and such that are designed to improve the lives of those who are sight impaired. However, Envision is the only company that takes it all a step further and really goes out of the way to research and implement new innovative technologies that other companies can only dream about adding to their products. This is because the people behind Envision are serious about their work, and they want to provide a product that not only works, but actually enriches the lives of the blind and visually impaired all around the world. So whether you have the app installed onto your phone, or you're using the new Envision glasses, you're sure to get as much information as possible about your surroundings and other things that you need on a daily basis that will help you work,learn or play. Envision's optical character recognition is far superior than many other apps and devices on the market today. You can read books, magazines and any text on any surface, even from television screens, computer screens and other digital displays. Envision is the only technology that encorporates real-time reading of text so that if you need to read house numbers, signs or anything else immediately, Envision AI can definitely handle it for you with no problem whatsoever. No other device or app can do this. So whether you're in school, working on the job, or whatever, Envision AI can do what you need it to do throughout your entire day without getting tired or giving up on you. You are able to read any printed text, and even some hand written text as well. The goal of Envision is to make blind or visually impaired people as independent as humanly possible without needing any assistance from a real human, but even if that's needed, you can still get human guidance because you can call someone and they're connected directly into the app, or into the glasses and they're seeing exactly what you see, so they can guid you around objects and such. Here again, no other device on the market can even do this. Envision AI is the only product that can provide this to the user. So as you can see, Envision AI is definitely hands down the winner here. It does far more than any other vision system on the market today.",11/09/21 0:01,1;2,5
BlindSquare,"This app continues to be the best blind GPS app for iOS. It seriously keeps getting better.

Be My Eyes,Please add a way for the caller to share their location. I received a call from lady who was lost in a parking lot in pitch black darkness. I couldn't be of any use to her.

I have done experimentations in my room, and it let me know what is around me as I pointed the camera at a specific location as voiceover reads the description when the picture is processed.

I am partially sight impaired myself, and this is an excellent way to either read menus or science, or just identify surroundings. I will give it more than five stars!",06/05/16 19:45,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,"A great idea, but poor follow up. I have had this app for over a year now, I have received total of 2 calls. It is a shame that there is such an imbalance between the number of volunteers and visually impaired people.

I find it difficult to understand how the same people who had the idea to create such an amazing app, does absolutely nothing to improve their app and awareness... SHAME",10/14/20 10:35,3,4

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,To say it is a really great app I am visually impaired and for me it works well please add more apps like this,08/09/23 7:16,1,5
Be My Eyes,This application helps the blind to be able to find stuff by themselves. For example you can make a call and ask someone to help you find a pill bottle that you miss placed. Or also if you dropped something and cannot find it you can call a volunteer and have them help you find some thing you've dropped as well. There are many different things you can use the application for. And the bee my ice team continues to make great strides every day for the application to work and be accessible for those of us who are blind or visually impaired. thank you be my ice team for the great work that you do in making this application accessible for those who are blind or visually impaired. Keep up the great work.,08/24/23 10:56,1;2,5

Seeing AI,I am a completely blind user of this app. I love the app 😊 I use it with voice over the screen mirror on Apple products with my iPhone. The only problem that I am seeing is it does not do a good job when you try to use it with those 2 L bottles of pop that people get Voice is not reading me any of the information the camera isn’t working and whether I use the short text or document mode it doesn’t work and doesn’t help and also voiceover is having trouble. It doesn’t say hold steady every time to know the cameras in the right place and lined up it’s not telling me every single time I think it’s a bug please fix all this if you can and add another mood for reading labels on 2 L bottles of pop.

Be My Eyes,"As volunteers who want to help and users who need help, people should be sharing this app like gossip at a church picnic. With so many volunteers, just about every informational resource available to visually impaired people should include this app. The ratio of volunteers/users is so immense, getting an actual call to action once a year is understandable. I'm going to be in a bit of self denial about the Data-Mining reviews, I'm hoping the trackers are to enhance connectivity.",09/03/20 17:34,-1,5

Be My Eyes,"Excellent service for visually impaired. I’ve helped the amazing people seeking help. I live in Hawaii, it seems I mostly get the later calls because of time zone. They love my nights sounds of coqui frogs singing & Roosters who crow all night. I super love this App",07/21/24 0:18,1,5
Be My Eyes,"It's hard to get on the phone. I get that. But when a sighted person gets on that line to help you… Listen to that person. I know it might be hard, but still… ""Blind man who leads puts everybody in a ditch"".

And especially if I am courteous enough to give you my name… You disrespect me again, and I'll clean out your filthy mouth.

Be My Eyes,"As someone with a visually impaired relative this app was of high interest to me. I’ve been a volunteer for a number of years and I love knowing that I’ve made someone’s life a little bit easier. The calls can go through phases of being regular and then you can go months without an alert, but this is due to how many volunteers there are which is great! You do have to answer quickly too, but again, this is such a good thing for those needing assistance! It would be nice to see a total figure for how many calls you’ve answered, especially when showing friends or family the app ☺️",03/02/21 3:36,2,5
Be My Eyes,This app has an amazing concept.  I’ve been a member since November 26th 2019.  I’ve received 2 calls and have had a great experience on here.  I feel so grateful and privileged to lend my eyesight to those who are blind or low vision.  This gives me a lot of faith in humanity and truly humbled me  I look forward to receiving more calls and assuring many others.,01/09/20 2:29,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Amazing - but talking to a blind friend of mine mine uses this app, I feel like a feedback feature may be needed? He has said that he has encountered a handful of people that were not helpful. I think it would be nice for people to be able to choose to not be matched with certain people again or to be more likely to be matched with others. Maybe this has been considered and it's not the best option or maybe the need to volunteer ratio is so different that it's just not an issue.. just a thought!",09/08/21 17:19,4,5
OneStep Reader,"Very good in my opinion for the price! In Romania I can not afford to buy the orcam device so this is the best replacement! And also is very good! I tryed it and is not good to live this 1 star review! You must try it and then you must live a review! I was so scared to buy it because of your reviews, but for me a future lawyer I am very glad to scan and read the Romanian law without a pc. If you are not satisfied whith the price just imagine how it costs to see! Do not misunderstand me! Is not cheep because romanian money are cheep so 1 usd is like 4.5 usd but my vision is more expensive then that! I am so glad that I can read !!! The reading devices are too expensive like the orcam my eye is 4 000 usd ! This is expensive not this app. Keep up the good work developers! Do not get descureged do this work for us for the people who need to read and who was borned whithout the capacity to read. Thenks a lot! And do not forgot that its good in romanian, the problem whith other apps is that they can not read good in romanian.",05/01/20 15:44,2,5
BlindSquare,"This is an excellent GPS program for the blind. It is great for walking as well as finding out what types of services are available near you. There is an email user group that provides excellent support and technical assistance, including from the developer himself. What I find most impressive, is the responsiveness of the developer to questions, comments, and general needs of the blind population. I heartily endorse this product.",06/18/13 20:21,1,5
Seeing AI,I am a newly visually impaired person. And I love this app as soon as I learn to use it. This app has a lot of amazing features that will help the blind community  with amazing visual description is that a sighted person would know which makes this apps incredible for what I can do for a blind person.The only concern with this app is Dad I would love a channel that Will describe colors for us the visually impaired community.,07/12/17 14:16,1;4,5
Be My Eyes,I am a volunteer and I just took my first call and was able to help a visually impaired person work a new light that his family bought for him! It was something so simple but it felt amazing to be able to help! I think this app is truly amazing and I can’t wait to keep taking calls and helping out!,01/21/20 5:27,2,5
Be My Eyes,"When the Android version of this finally appeared, I was excited to have a chance to help vision-impaired people in such an ingenious way. (It also seemed to make sense for the developers to stop focusing exclusively on Apple owners—who are, in my experience, more likely to be preoccupied with style and status than ""the rest of us"" are.) However, after having it installed for months, and not getting a single help request, I'm giving up. I'm glad the volunteer response has been so overwhelming—better that than too few—but there's also something to be said for, you know, actually getting to help someone sometime..?",10/06/18 11:42,3,3
Be My Eyes,I needed to read the label on a very tiny little bottle. I am totally blind so there was no way I could find out what it said. I got a very nice young lady who helped me very quickly and gave me the information I needed. I was so excited I could hardly stand it.,09/06/19 4:21,2,5
Be My Eyes,"This is such an innovative way to help a visually impaired person when they are needing at the most. It takes only a few minutes to assist them, and it’s based on your availability.I just finished my first call, and it was such an enjoyable experience.",06/12/21 16:42,1,5

TapTapSee,"Seriously! This thing’s ability to recognize objects is strange. It seems to be some mix between OCR and object recognition. I took the same photo from my library and put it into both google’s photo ID software (it gave back just “cat”) and into this and it identified the color and the HAIR LENGTH of my cat. Like… what!? 

Completely blown away by this thing’s power. All it needs is a better UI to go with it, but to be honest I don’t think that matters considering it’s meant for blind people, so a “fancy” UI will only make VoiceOver worse.",04/11/16 20:17,1;2;3,5
Be My Eyes,I just recently downloaded this app after seeing a post about it on Instagram. I haven’t gotten a call yet but I can’t wait to help with people with their everyday tasks. I already volunteer a bunch for businesses where I live but this is a different type of volunteering. Not only am I helping Americans but I am also most likely helping people worldwide. I just puts a constant smile on my face to know that a simple answer can help a blind person greatly. I can’t wait to get my first call so I can help someone in need.,07/29/22 15:09,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Though my eyes are absolutely terrible (somewhere over 20/400…after that they stop measuring), my glasses mostly correct that.  I can’t imagine not having that remedy!  So, I’ve been a member of the “Be My Eyes” community for over 2 years.  Through video calls received on the Be My Eyes app, I’ve helped the blind and seeing-impaired identify cereal boxes, set temperature on new kitchen appliances, and a lot more that I can’t remember.  It’s a great experience for both you and the caller.  I encourage anyone to sign up and volunteer to be someone’s eyes.",11/05/22 23:15,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I downloaded and waited two weeks, with no calls for help. Then I thought, it would probably be much more runner to meet people if I pretended and signed up as a blind person. And I KNOW I'm not the only one thinking that. So there must be a lot of jokers, trolls, etc for example (can you tell me which testicle is my left one?) it seems there should. Be a way to validate if you are truly blind somehow...and again.. No instructions  ... I don't know if I have to have the app open the whole time or what. But sitting around for five or six hours til you get one call? Seems unbalanced. And a lotttt of flaws.. Though I do love the simple interface I just don't know what the heck I'm supposed to be doing",01/24/15 3:12,2,2
Be My Eyes,"At first glance I want to give this app 10 stars, due to the fact, I have had multiple acquaintances that were losing their vision, and lost their vision, and as I get older I noticed my vision not being as great as it was, so excellent idea to be able to help people with something that is so easily taken for granted",05/17/24 4:38,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Being able to stop what I am doing and help people who need it is the most fulfilling part of this app. I don’t personally know any visually impaired people, but if I did this would be the first app I recommend to them.

Be My Eyes,"This app gives me so much as a volunteer, I can only imagine how much a visually impaired person appreciates it.

Be My Eyes,"Saw this on the BBC and immediately put my name down for the Android version which I downloaded a few weeks ago.. Brilliant concept and app which is a blessing for any blind person in need of information that can so easily and willingly be provided by a sighted volunteer.  I was so happy to assist my first caller yesterday to identify the colour of the dress she was showing me. It was so quick, easy and effective and made me feel good to be able to help a complete stranger .  This is such a wonderful and practical application of technology.",11/04/17 4:45,2,5
Be My Eyes,This app is a great idea and perfectly executed. For blind users this is great and there's so much help instantly at your fingertips. No long waits in ques for help just instantly answered. However for volunteers I don't suggest at this time downloading this app at this time because there's 2.5 million volunteers and only 137k blind looking for help. So many people want to help that it could be weeks or months before you get one call.,07/06/19 11:27,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve been able to answer two calls and help to the best of my ability! Both individuals were super sweet and we chatted for a bit also during the call. I love being able to take something that I take for granted most days and use that to help others live more independent lives. And for everyone giving 1 stars because they haven’t gotten any calls, look at the blind to volunteer ratio!",08/05/20 5:50,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I love the idea behind this app. I’ve had it downloaded for several months now and I’ve gotten 3 calls so far, so it’s not something that happens too often. The first two calls were answered by someone else, but just the other day I got to assist for the first time. This is a small way I can help others without having to interfere with my schedule or plan it out. Do you have time to help? No, then okay, no big deal. If you do, awesome! I only wish more blind/low vision people knew about it. Perhaps some sort of additional outreach? Though I guess it’s a good thing that there are so many volunteers. It’s a great cause and I’ll continue to wait the next time I get to be of help.",12/14/18 23:14,1,5

TapTapSee,I really love this application! It's accessible and blind friendly. I really think that there should be more applications like this that work well with VoiceOver to make the iPhone even better for those that are blind or visually impaired. : ),06/21/13 12:03,1,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,"I'm not blind, but I think it's cool. It's VERY fast to say something, at least on my phone (S22 5G). Sometimes it is a bit wrong, like ""flower"" for plants, ""stairs"" for a fence.

Check the meters. 
Turn washing machine correctly. 
Even help to shop online something. 
Some lady ask me how she looks and does she need to to dye her hair. 
And you even can’t imagine how important was the app in the first days of russian invasion in Ukraine. People call for help, for support and just to talk a little to not be alone in hard days. 
Thank you!",08/25/23 15:03,2,5
Be My Eyes,"This is the real experience behind support in the blind community and Making connections I never knew was possible! So far I have had 4 experiences with calls. My latest one was sadly answered quicker by someone else. On my first support call, the person was looking to ensure they looked good for a date. Not only could I say she was stunning but I was also in the meeting with an Ojibwe Alder who is then able to talk about body positivity and loving ourselves in our own skin. 5 stars",07/25/21 7:56,2,5

Be My Eyes,Just updated my phone OS and possibly this app updated itself I don't know but I've suddenly started being spammed by push noticications. The app tells me I have to have push notifications enabled for me to help people with limited vision. That's an absolute joke and I'm going to delete the app as I refuse to be spammed through an app where I'm helping people for free.,02/16/23 14:54,3,1
Be My Eyes,"It took a few weeks before I got a call but when I did it was totally worth it. It was from a blind man who had been taken to the emergency room and he wanted someone to describe the scene to him and help him get his bearings and to make sure there were medical personnel around. I can't imagine a scarier thing than being blind in the chaotic mess of an ER. 
This is the most awesome concept and use of technology I can imagine. Please encourage everyone you know to download it. It takes just a little time out of your day and it can mean the world to someone.",01/29/15 15:49,2,5
Supersense - AI for Blind,"I have been using this app for about three months now. I find it to be very user-friendly. It goes above and beyond what you see from similar apps like Seeing AI and Envision. Yes, you do have to purchase a subscription, but I think that it is totally worth it. The smart scan feature is awesome because it is intuitive and allows you to read or recognize a multitude of things without having to change between features. I especially love the barcode scanner. I find it to be very helpful and I love that you don’t have to manually go back a screen to scan the next barcode. You can just keep scanning product after product and getting results every time. I highly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or visually impaired. Check out the webinar on the blog of world services for the blind if you want to see some demonstrations",11/17/21 4:59,1,5

Be My Eyes,This is a great app. I'm a new volunteer and the man I helped with my first (and only call so far) was extremely grateful I could help him. He said even though the questions and needs may seem small they are a big deal to the blind community. It was also fun to have a short chat with him; someone who lives on the other side of the country from me but quickly didn't feel like a stranger at all.,08/16/21 16:21,1,5

Now, when someone sends me a picture I can just use the app instead of asking them what it is.

Seeing AI,"I am not blind (and thank goodness), merely have failing sight.  But I cannot imagine being completely sightless and being able to utilize this app for anything.  The periodic pop up warnings and tutorial screens give NO auditory alerts.  So I could picture it being endlessly frustrating for someone who couldn't see the screen.  

That being said, this is an interesting display of advancements in AI visual interpretation.  It does recognize certain things, and even read a pill bottle label to me.",07/15/17 15:38,1,3

Let me get to the point it helps me, and it makes me laugh. I recommended for blind and visually impaired people and kids all alike. I can describe things and color scenery people money parentheses same thing this morning you can also described like you can read a book to you or document can you print read your homework if it’s not in braille 17! Anyway I’m only 10 years old i’m only 10 to 10 years old what do you expect for me like I’m just a kid what do you expect. I don’t do much when is my nap and I have fun and I love you and I love math that’s all that matters family and friends that’s why my daddy got me this app it’s quite amazing I enjoy it it’s wonderful I would recommend it for every single person in animal there is out there yeah animal just look at my rating of five stars I’m not kidding sorry if this review is so long but it’s for your own goods

I love cats I know I’m going to scream and this will help me to my dinghy mean cancel my Books app and brow on Tigard there for a little kids come on who wants to re-find your own books one who wants read books for five-year-olds when they’re 10 seriously seriously are you kidding me hello keep reading?!!!!!!!!! 

I recommend

I recommend that you add more things to your out to me why so I can see how old you are you know who is or you can like be used outside I tried it outside once and you didn’t work can you fix that?!

This is a really long long movie for teen! I am just trying to tell everyone how good this happens I heard the review about the stupid Facebook mission thing to wrong like I mean it just makes me laugh when I guess the wrong name I am too but I guess I was like five or seven or three or four and want to even make me want to sound all that and that he enjoys your new mother and younger image means one to your family sure I want to have friends over but it’s a pretty good app 

I do a lot of stuff anyway enjoy some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it another time it’s not a made in pain I had to giggle about that want to do you guys any new you I do a lot of stuff anyway I’m enjoying some fascination information why won’t anyone seen a man sitting on the clock when I took a picture of the clock when my dad was fixing it yeah sure it was wrong but I enjoyed it I had a good hearty laugh about it and another tell me tell me an opinion I had a giggle about that want to do you guys any new people that say that something you know is kind of weird because it’s not working you guys might be right but you guys are wrong as well and you shouldn’t know if it’s wrong it’s just it’s not
 

Anyway I don’t know much and what was I saying oh yeah so people can just have a laugh about it instead of complaining to you guys everyone should have a box of medication laughter is the best medicine just take some funny pictures and have a good life and you should be cured that is the best medicine laughter is the best medicine understand if you can’t figure out what the medicine is when I ask ask someone who can’t see I can’t see really good myself out of me to reach mom. But I can still use this app why I want to say when you say well for some envelopes and I found all the information from my school on my own without

Once I even use this app to read envelopes and I found all the envelopes from my school on my own except for the set this up was my only guide you must just keep flipping the box with the Haitian around and eventually you’ll find the right spot that’s what I do with the envelopes sure he takes a while but after a while it’s worth it I love school it’s the best thing everyone just needs to chill lax it’s not a big deal. Everyone just keeps saying all this that this that blah blah blah it’s annoying so I need you to do people is to download this app my review should and if you more things

So anyway the next thing is to blow my true name I know it’s is with me and I will have you go to Abby Cool whatever I want I want to talk I think I don’t know I’m using voice so I don’t know why it’s wrong here is my true identity and the next thing he wake ups

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Google your application is very good, we also add Hindi language to it for the visually impaired, because we also use this app from India, if you insist on Hindi language in it, then it will be very useful for us, this application made by you With folded hands, you request that you add Hindi language as soon as possible.",09/01/20 22:54,3,5
Be My Eyes,"I have been enrolled to assist since October of 2018. Over the years I have answered many calls. Putting myself into each situation and encouraging each caller as I assist gives me a smile and knowing that I can help. 
I have answered 3 calls most recently that are things that (sighted) people might take for granted. 
1. A lady was given a new stove and needed to verify the knobs for burners, and that she had the oven on, and help setting the temperature and timer. We also verified the shelves located inside and we changed them. She was so excited to use her new stove, and I shared the excitement with her. 
2. An older woman was sick and had new medication brought to her from the pharmacy. She needed to read labels and take notes to be sure she was taking it correctly. 
I know braille might be very helpful if the label came that way. Maybe someone will invent it. I reassured her to call us if she was uncertain even a little bit. And with my (our) helping, she said it gave her so much relief from anxiety. 
3. A college student had a new computer given to her and it was set up for her sight issues. She had turned it on and could tell the color emitted was not what she was use to. I described the screen and explained in order the icons down the left side. I know about basic set up and we reviewed some things she needed to know had the vocal assist set up. We even changed the background color to what she had been use to on her other computer. I shared her excitement for her new gift. 

As I said simple to assist with but each were so grateful.

Oko - Cross streets and Maps,It was amazing a free app that let me cross streats safely. Oh wait an update comes and now instead of an optional donation to help the team make Oko. It’s not required to pay a subscription to use Oko. I think it’s cruel that we are now charging blind people to have the ability to cross the street safely. Oko I hope someone sues you for this,04/01/25 15:09,2;3,3

TapTapSee,"App can recognize any object, place, part, thing... Just point the camera, take a picture, and it will accurately speak what is in that direction. Since it's specifically built for the blind, it will tell you where the mail came from, what color is a shirt, who is the person in front of you and what they look like and so on. A+++

This is one tool that no blind person should live without!",02/16/14 7:12,2,5

Envision AI,"it suits its name. a great ai assistant to the blind. in future updates include more offline reading, writing, sharing, language, motion, interactive and senser as well as identification features like currency identification.

Be My Eyes,This app is so incredibly and amazingly useful!!! The fact that there are so many volunteers is so beautiful and the whole app is so easy to use. I’m so so so glad that I came across this up and I 100% positively recommend it to any visual impaired individual😍💝💐,09/20/18 12:46,1,5
Be My Eyes,"First of all, what an amazing app to create I order to love the blind well and help them live their lives!!! Such a caring mindset around this app, it’s astounding. I am a seeing volunteer and got my first call today and it was incredible!! I take seeing for granted- and this app helps me use my sight for good and hopefully bring others a small amount of peace in the aid of their disability🥰 literally love this so much",09/14/21 20:52,1,5

Be My Eyes,It’s nice that the blind have people to help them with every day activities!!! The only downside is that it takes a couple weeks to get your first call... but that’s ok 😺😊,01/15/20 12:49,1,5
TapTapSee,I love this app for several reasons. Number one it opens up a lot to the blind individual. There's a lot of world out there and a lot of it is limited because I can't see. However once downloading this app it opened up a lot of things to me. Things such as doors windows building layouts etc. even describing movies. Thank you thank you for helping the blind people see.,03/08/17 19:41,1,5
Be My Eyes,This is an amazing idea. What a fabulous app. I took my first call and the user wanted me to help identify labels. It was a very short call so took up very little of my time but I would have no issue even it it did as it gave me great satisfaction that I was able to help someone who was visually impaired. I look forward to helping more users in the future. Highly recommend.,06/11/23 1:18,2,5

BlindSquare,"I've used BlindSquare for around a year.

I'm getting better and better at using Simulate Location and My Places to build my mental map of intersections and points of interest where I plan to be.

While I'm walking or riding, I mostly use my Braille Sense with app sounds turned off, iPhone muted, and volumes set to 0.
I find BlindSquare very difficult to use in this fashion, so Ariadne GPS is my main ""where am I?"" app, and I love exporting places from BlindSquare to Ariadne GPS.

In other GPS apps, I can make the braille display tolerably stable while I'm moving, but,  in BlindSquare, I have a hard time reading and navigating the screen (using my Braille Sense) unless my GPS location is stable.

At some point, I'll get into the place check-in feature, but I'm still mounting the smartphone mentality learning curve.",03/16/15 14:03,2,4

Be My Eyes,"First time, I was able to help someone out. All he wanted was to ask me to see the charging level of his power bank. Because he was blind, I was able to help directing him to point the camera at the indicator.  Just a small act of kindness but it made me happy that I could help.

Be My Eyes,"I m glad they have such a helpful app for helping the people out! Keep up the great work !

Cash Reader for the Blind,"This app is incredible. I love how I can scan any kind of money from  around the world and get instant feedback on what the denomination of the cash is. I was sad to see money reader go, but cash reader is the ultamate app for determining the denomination of the bill.  I love the fact that I can just pull out my phone and hold up the bill and immediately get virbal feedback on how much it is worth. For years I have been struggling to find the right app for reading money but now, I don't have to do that anymore. I strongly recommend this app for anyone who is blind or low vision and is tired of fumbleing around with  loose bills or having to ask someone to read your cash to you. It is the best talking money app identifier  out there.  I will never go without my cash reader out and ready to go again.",05/30/21 10:34,1,5

Within the first few weeks of becoming a volunteer I was able to answer two separate calls; both visually impaired people were so kind and appreciative for the help, and I felt great being able to assist them with small tasks in which I take my own vision for granted. With millions of volunteers and only a few hundred thousand members who are visually impaired, calls are far and few between. I personally even know many people who are not blind but are visually impaired in some way and would benefit from an app like this if they got over that sense of “pride” and just asked for help.

Out of hundreds of pictures taken--everything from the sky, to a ceiling light, to a road, to a vacuum, to a car in motion, to a parked car, to a chair, to a crock pot--there was only one time it was tripped up, and that was forgivable; it mistook a white bathmat hanging on a towel rack for a white bath towel.

Be My Eyes,My first call I was actually scrolling Facebook on my phone and was so thrilled I tapped away! The dear sweet lady was needing help identifying cleaning products. It is such amazing technology and I praise the person/people that thought of this! I told my office mate about this app her son is visually impaired we discussed that it's a comfort knowing that when he is older there will be not only be amazing technology as this but possibly more advanced technology to help him live more independently!,07/30/18 0:53,2,5
Be My Eyes,"I got to answer my first call yesterday and it’s really heart filling! Although I’m only slightly visually  impaired & not blind, I really enjoy sharing my vision. It’s really a sweet feeling when you know you actually helped someone and it’s so humbling  ❤️❤️❤️",06/26/20 19:47,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I downloaded be my eyes a couple years ago with zero expectations. I have some vision issues and have been told I will eventually go blind, so I figured I would help while I could. It started very slow, maybe 2 calls the first year. Now I average a call per month. These calls have ranged from helping with outfits, reading bills, and my favorite, a positive pregnancy test. Be my eyes has been such a reward and blessing for me!",05/06/20 15:07,2,5
Be My Eyes,"Hi I am from pakistan and I am blind person. This app is very useful. Specially, the specialised help system is fine we can contact with Google and Microsoft to improve our accessibility apps. I love this app very much. You have right to get 5 stars. That's why I give you five star",10/28/19 9:07,1,5
Be My Eyes,How does one that is blind download this app or even open it if they are blind and if someone opens the app for them wouldn't they just ask them???,01/20/20 22:31,-1,5
Be My Eyes,I am a visually impaired person and I keep calling but nobody answers my calls and also when I click on the specialised help everything is close this app is stupid and never helps with anything and why the age is 17+ why cannot the kids this app is dumb and stupid stupid app this is my opinion I think this app must go away forever it won’t work and it won’t help any blind or visually impairment,05/27/21 19:03,3,1
Be My Eyes,"Honestly this is such an amazing app! Being able to help those who are blind or visually impaired is such a good feeling!
Everyone I have had the pleasure to assist has been so lovely and so grateful for the app and the help it give them access too! 

Would highly recommend EVERYONE to download and/or spread the word!!",11/27/20 2:12,1,5
Be My Eyes,as a sighted person being able to answer a call to assist a blind or low-vision user is truly the easiest thing to do.,05/28/23 0:01,1,5
Be My Eyes,Glad to be part of the Be My Eyes volunteer community. This app is a simple yet ingenious way for those people with vision challenges or sight loss to get assistance quickly with everyday tasks.,09/27/22 14:56,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Great resource. There are so many more volunteers that people who actually need help. Which is fantastic, however, the app is taking space and I've never used it in the month I've had it so I may end up deleting it if I'm not needed. Keep in mind that this just means that they are already receiving help from someone else, which is GREAT. 💕 So happy that there is a resource like this for the blind. 😊",02/10/20 9:15,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I received my first call not long after signing up and helped a blind person. They wanted me to tell them if a piece of bread looked moldy and if an avocado looked ok. I was glad to be able to help them.
8/30/2018 I love this app and being able to help people. I wish that I would be able to write a short description of any glitches though. The only option you get at the end of the call is where there any technical difficulties yes or no.",08/30/18 21:31,2;3,5
Be My Eyes,Have been answering calls for the impaired for years! Fantastic idea :) app works great!,05/14/23 19:55,1,5
Be My Eyes,"Really love this app, is very functional for blind people, and I'm glad to be a volunteer for this good reason. I downloaded the app yesterday and today I had my first request 🙌🏻",07/29/20 22:28,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I have only use this app I handful of times, but every time it was a huge help. The most memorable was when I decided to use this to find out my babies gender. The woman helping me seemed genuinely delighted to tell me, and it took all of the pressure off of me with friends and family wanting to be the first to know. I didn’t have to choose who would read the gender reveal to me. I wish this app could expand to include a social network. I think it would be huge if people were able to build a report together, and it wasn’t just at random. That way more visually impaired people would feel more confident using this service. Overall I love it",10/15/19 21:45,2,5
Be My Eyes,It's 1st app which gave 100% satisfaction to me. Now I can say that I am not blind. Thanks and many many congratulation to its developer from my deep heart. I loved it very much.  Thanks.,10/09/17 5:59,1,5

Seeing Eye GPS,"This is a very, very, very good one point zero release. The app works very well. The price of the app is great, it is compairible to mainstream GPS subscription price points, and it is fully accessible to the blind. The days of using three apps to walk down the street are now gone. Congratulations to the Sendero team for a job well done",07/06/13 16:27,1,4
Be My Eyes,This app is a great resource for folks that want to help out the Blind and Vision impaired. It took like 2 minutes to sign up and I had my first call the same day. I helped an elderly woman find a sandal her non service animal had taken. Thank You Be My Eyes for being an incredibly easy app to use and the fact that it's free is incredible because so many folks are on a limited or fixed income. I would love to learn more as I am a member of the lions club and want to share the awesomeness.,04/17/24 18:18,1,5
Lookout - Assisted vision,nice application this app is fast working but please include in this app colour recognise software so blind people can recognise colour properly and according to my experience this app is not properly working in object recognition mode so kindly solve this problem,05/20/22 20:58,1;4,3
Seeing AI,"I see so many possibilities for this app. It’s very user friendly. My 5 year old nephew loved the People part and was taking pictures of everyone! When showing it to colleagues, they immediately planned on installing it for their elderly parents. Office Lens is a little more accurate for full document reading, but the short text works great! I often recommend it and use it myself, even though I’m not visually impaired. The development team is amazing and responsive to feedback. Way to go!",01/29/18 16:15,2,5

THEY SHOULD PUT U WITH A BLIND PERSON, AND ONLY THEY CALL U!",10/12/17 19:55,3,1
Be My Eyes,"This seems to provide the enhanced self-esteem & overall rewarding feeling of altruism in the most facile, cursory manner possible. Just join the massive surplus of “volunteers;” receive a few  calls a year; if you try, possibly even be first to answer one. In that unlikely event, spend up to several minutes helping someone. Rarely if ever asked—never required—to  do anything, and still enjoy that good deed ego boost! Feel like a do-gooder all the time just for being “on call,” without having to take any given call. 

If that sounds like hyperbole, read through the reviews. Ask yourself, who is this app helping most– those with vision impairment, or those who want to feel like a good person without all the work?

It seems to me that a more efficient, formal setup could provide more than a free-for-all massive surplus volunteer approach. This would involve investment in setting up infrastructure like a vetting process; organized, predetermined shifts, during which the sighted user agrees to actually be on call; and some sort of incentive (maybe an accrued reward system like survey apps use) for those providing reliable, quality service. If that fundamental system were well-built to be scalable, the potential for what the service could accomplish is enormous.",06/20/24 4:04,4,3
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I used to love this app, it helped me cross streets in my community and was very unique. It felt like the developer had a passion for their work. However, now that the app has switched to a subscription only model (with no regard for legacy users) I will no longer be supporting it or recommending it to O&M professionals or other blind people. I'm very disappointed that the developer feels that this is the only way to make money, and that they choose to add a subscription to their existing app with no other benefit to subscribing besides getting to continue enjoying the previously free features. I hope the developer realizes most blind people have 0 extra income to use on continuous subscriptions, and that they have just alienated 95% of there users at minimum. I have lost all interest in this project and at a loss in regards to this decision by the dev.",01/08/25 0:07,2;3,1
Envision AI,Can it be used by person with glare issue to read computer or to cross the road etc.,03/16/23 3:44,2,5
NaviLens,"This app is pointless as you have to print your own labels. I don’t have a printer and, as I am totally blind, could not possibly know if the tags had been printed or not. This means that I would need both a printer and sighted help to create my own tags, negating independent living. Waste of time! Glad that it is free because worthless!",01/29/21 20:15,3,1
TapTapSee,"I don't use this app much, mainly because I forget I have it, but when I am getting really frustrated with the restrictions I have with being blind I think of it. I mainly  use it for the picture id. I love that I don't have to say anything since I hate recording my voice.",03/07/15 12:16,2,5
Oko - Cross streets and Maps,"I was initially very impressed with this app, which provided blind and visually impaired users with a safe way to cross streets independently. It was a groundbreaking tool that gave a sense of autonomy to a community that often faces significant mobility challenges. However, my enthusiasm has turned to disappointment with the recent introduction of a paywall and subscription model. This decision is deeply troubling, as it restricts access to a service that is vital for users who already face financial hardships. Many in this community have limited incomes, and making such an essential app unaffordable feels exploitative and unjust. It’s shocking and unacceptable that a tool designed to empower is now a source of exclusion. The developers should rethink their approach, as this paywall undermines the app’s purpose and alienates those it was meant to help.",01/10/25 11:20,3,1

Be My Eyes,This app is really helpful for the blind. Everything is accessible and there's loads of options available for you to use. I love this app I wish there was more out there,05/01/23 17:09,1,5
Be My Eyes,I am very thankful for all of the volunteers to take their time to assist us blind individuals. I am disappointed in the fact that it takes sometimes a very long time to find a volunteer. I have friends that also are volunteers for the app and they said that the ringtone that they have is not very distinguished and that it is easy to miss a call. Therefore it should not be a beep butt and actual ringtone when searching for a volunteer. Other than this it is a fantastic app and does impact the lives of blind people all over the world.,02/20/19 13:29,1,4
Be My Eyes,Really interesting service. Makes me excited to use it. I haven’t been able to help anyone yet though because of the disproportionate amount of volunteers to blind people. Almost 10 to 1. I’ve received 3 calls but I’ve never been fast enough to answer them. Makes my heart jump every time though. I’ve drop things I never thought I would drop to try to answer the call.,07/19/19 19:49,1,5
Be My Eyes,This app is a use for people that are legally blind or fully blind that needed assistance for anything.,07/18/24 16:16,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Update after three years continuous use as a sighted helper:  the app has come a long way in development (wasn’t horrible at the beginning though) and is now very solid and refined.  Excellent software and network.

With 0.8 million sighted folks on the net at this writing expect anytime/all the time assistance if you are blind / VI, and an incoming call every few months if you are sighted.

Give it a try without hesitation.

——-(original review)——-

Been a sighted helper on the net for a couple years.  Current version has decent connection stability, very easy to take a call and render assistance when needed.  If I’m unavailable (driving, busy, etc.) the notification is distinct but NOT invasive, and it clears quickly without intervention.  Nearby folks will notice it but it’s unlikely you get harsh reactions if a call comes in at a bad time.

Due to the huge sighted : blind ratio of users on the net, incoming assist calls will be very infrequent.  If you get 10 a year, consider yourself lucky unless you sign up as fluent in multiple languages.

As a sighted helper, It’s EASY to do, FUN to help folks, and takes virtually ZERO time and effort.  As a blind user, know that there’s an army of “light dependent” folks eager and excited to lend a hand anytime and as often as you like.

This a great network.  One of the best applications of smartphone tech I’ve encountered.  Grab a copy and join in.",01/30/18 16:15,1,5

Seeing Eye GPS,Works pretty good. There is no GPS that is exactly perfect every time. Some of the things that people are hoping for are not feasible and even some not possible. Google POIs are very crucial to this app and cooperation should happen in order to maintain them. The blind community has come to depend on this app for mobility independence and even safety. So let’s work together and find a way to make it happen.,05/28/18 22:12,1;2,4

Wanna know the license plate number of the car in your driveway? This app does all of that quickly and easily. You do have to pay after the first hundred photos as some kinds of pictures are crowdsourced for answers, but it's entirely worth it.

Be My Eyes,I have had this app for a couple of years and I have only had a couple of calls.

How she accessed the BeMyEyes phone app is a mystery to me.

BlindSquare,"This app is amazing. I bought it before moving back to Northwest Portland. I've been blind my entire life, and the one thing that often bugs me about cane travel is needing to keep the running mental narrative of what street I'm at. Everyone knows your mind wanders, you're thinking about something else, work, the kids, even just something you passed by. BlindTquare alleviates this problem. But, but, but, ... There's more!
I moved back into a neighborhood I'd lived in before. But one thing about being blind, you miss a lot just generally running around. I was amazed at what I found just turning on a couple of options, and having it tell me what I passed. BlindSquare is a great addition to the iOS ecosystem, and I for one am really impressed! I haven't tried turn by turn because I grew up on these streets and so I know the place, and the addressing system, like the back of my hand. Yet even for it to tell me bus, streetcar and train stops is amazing! I haven't lived here since before we had access to iOS, and now it's as though Portland just got a brand-new look, all because of BlindSquare and the iPhone!",11/16/13 17:31,2,5

Be My Eyes,"I'm totally blind and just used Be My Eyes successfully for the first time. I've tried it before but my Internet was never good enough. I have a different phone and carrier now, so I tried it again. My computer seemed frozen, and my screen reader wouldn't talk at all. I'm alone, so I installed Be My Eyes, called a volunteer and asked what it was doing. She confirmed that it was frozen and not responding at all, so I was able to restart it and get things going again. I had a wonderful experience using it and will definitely keep it installed! I'm glad so many volunteers are willing to help!",03/01/18 15:50,1,5

Seeing AI,"... useful for those of us with limited sight. Did some basic testing, and it’s not perfect, but what is? 😉

Wasn’t great with the colours, but I suspect that’s because the light was too bright from the phone, and it was bouncing-off reflections of that light, making darker colours appear brighter, or altering the colour detected completely.

For those of us with NO colour vision, this would likely cause issues, but I usually get family to help me when needed 👍.

The product ID worked on the 3 products I tested, it was flawless 😀.

The text/document test was ok, but as usual for these talking apps, I had to slow it down to make it more legible.

Overall, a very useful app, but needs work in some areas 😊👍.",02/20/18 8:56,2;3,4

Be My Eyes,amazing idea to help blind people,02/02/19 20:31,1,5
Be My Eyes,Hi I am been active since more than 6 months. The purpose of creating this app is good and impressive. But I come across that one user is misusing this app and he himself has portrating as blind person. I know the case is negligible compared to the benefits received by number of persons . But my intension is that the objective of creating this app should not deviate or misuse. Since many volunteers are supporting voluntuarly and should not feel absurd about this noble cause.,03/07/23 5:11,6,5

Be My Eyes,Now I have only had the opportunity to assist 4-5 times so far. That being said I loved all my interactions. The appreciation and gratitude that was expressed was unnecessary as I was the one who was appreciative for the opportunity to serve. This has opened my eyes to a whole new world. Thanks so much. I hope that more seeing impaired utilize this resource.,08/09/24 3:50,1,5

As stated title I’ve never gotten a notification and that’s not a problem at all but while downloading the app, I was so excited to actually make a difference and help someone. I absolutely love the fact that over 2 million people have volunteered on this app but I feel there is a large number of visually impaired individuals who do not know about the app. I strongly feel the creators of the app need to advertise on a larger scale or start branching out so the app can be more accessible to everyone who needs it.",08/07/19 15:06,1,5
Be My Eyes,Love the idea of this app but there are some technical issues. I’m a volunteer and I received a call to help someone. However the video quality was very blurry and hard to help the person even though I had stable internet connection.

Right now they have help constantly, but when the time comes, it’s great to know there are apps like this one that don’t cost a thing and have volunteers just waiting in the wings to help another human being.

Be My Eyes,"What a wonderful opportunity this app has given me. As a sighted volunteer, I feel so fortunate to have the chance to help someone. We have more than enough bad things going on this planet, BME has put together people who need each other. The visually impaired have always been at the forefront of people who I respect. It takes a person of strong fortitude and nerves of steel to be able to survive in this age of callousness. 

When I took my first call I wanted to make sure that I did it correctly. The gentleman that I assisted was so kind. My heart sank when the call ended because I felt that I did not do enough. Even the shortest call can make such a big impact on the lives of all involved. I will definitely be in for the long hall. This app should be #1 in the App Store.",06/09/18 22:47,1;2,5

My Dad was completely blind, and as he passed away in '95 there wasn't anything like this, but I know it would have been a massive help to him.

Be My Eyes,"As a sighted person who worked for many years for a visually impaired person, I was thrilled when I learned of this app's existence. I immediately read up on it and then signed up. That was a few weeks ago, and I've since had the privilege of helping two users. While the connection has been a bit spotty on my two calls, it certainly didn't prevent us from getting the task at hand successfully completed. And to address another of the whiners' complaints, yes, you may indeed go for a couple or more weeks without getting a call. Here's the thing: that is not a problem. For heaven's sake, think this through. Isn't it a wonderful thing that there are so many potential helpers?!  Be My Eyes is a marvel and a godsend to those who need it. And it also has the happy bonus of being a way for those of us who like to help people to do so, easily and instantly and completely at our convenience.

Be My Eyes,"This is an exceptional idea for an app. It's also well executed overall. 
The app works as advertised, and the selection of languages impressed me (I 
was pleasantly surprised to see even Esperanto included!). The only 
downside is the extreme rarity of receiving a call as a volunteer. It seems 
new volunteers often get a call within the first day - probably to keep 
them interested - but after that calls are few and far between. I received 
one call on my first day, but it was answered by another volunteer before I 
could get it. After that I received no calls for a couple weeks despite 
keeping the app running 24/7. Yesterday I finally received another call, 
which I answered. It seems much more promotion among the blind/vision 
impaired community is needed to help even out the numbers and so that even 
more people can be helped. Still, the app is an amazing resource for those 
who use it, and I'll keep it installed for those rare times when I may be 
available to assist quicker than anyone else. As someone who routinely 
relies on help from others due to health issues, it's nice to be able to 
help others once in awhile, too.",05/11/18 15:52,1,4

I just feel amazing that I was able to help someone and I wanted to share my experience that other people will sign up too. 
I love it!

Lookout - Assisted vision,"Recent update is HORRIBLE. The old version was really helpful with some fixable flaws. The new version is HORRIBLE and a huge downgrade. No consideration has been provided in making it easy for blind person to navigate the app. The old version had an easy to use and intuitive (and a ""talking"") interface. This has all been thrown away. What a disappointment! (Note to designers: Blindfold yourself and try to use the app. If this isn't easy to do-then you have failed!)

I was trying to use this app with numerous items around the house, and it seems to recognize all of them. It even told me that the ball I was holding was red.

Be My Eyes,"Someone recommended me this app. I thought about it for awhile, is my vision low enough to use this app? With my glasses I can okay. But when I misplaced my glasses, I can’t see to find them. So that is what I have used the app for. Not having to spend 20 minutes trying to “feel” for them has been great.

can help you to translate your app language to my country official

of blind people based on location (gps) or based on member country so 
member can give help in emergency situation for the blind people. In my 
country Indonesia, very limited facility for blind people,I do have high 
hopes to this app maybe I can help blind people for free transportation in 
case I'm going to a place where the blind people also want to go there or 
have same direction as well. So because the app still have no further

I have received one call so far and the video interface worked well and the audio was clear. I have already shared the app with my friends in the hopes that they will also create an account and be on call for future “be my eyes” opportunities. I hope that the future holds more opportunities for people to come together to make the world more accessible. Thank you again!,05/07/21 23:49,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"I can’t believe how many self entitled reviewers are giving this app a negative review because they “weren’t given enough time to answer” or never get to answer calls as if this is some game they’re not being picked to play in. If Someone else gets there faster than you, then that means someone who needed help got it quicker and that’s never a bad thing and it means the app is working as intended… with as little wait time as possible for the blind/visually impaired. This app works for those who need it and not for those who want to pat themselves on the back. I’ve had 3 interactions in 3 years and many calls where I wasn’t the one to be connected. If you really want to be available to help then it’s worth it to keep the app on your phone for that one time where maybe not many people are in a position to answer the call, but you are.",03/17/23 6:04,-1,5

Be My Eyes,How do the blind people call us,06/30/20 8:28,-1,5
Be My Eyes,"First, let me say that I think it's unfair to rate this app with one star because you haven't received a help call. It's quite obvious there are at minimum 10x more blind people then their are helpers. Be patient & feel honored to even be able to be a part of this.
  I think people abusing this app to make fun of people should be reported & banned. Helpers who truly have big hearts & want to be a part of something big, can't when cruel volunteers are getting calls. 
 This is a great concept & I can't wait to see this app grow & thrive.

Update 9/2016*** 
I have had a couple calls try and come through but I wasn't available for them. Today however my first call came through and I got to help a young woman by describing earrings to her.

Doesn't matter how good of an OCR an app is, if a blind person isn't able to take a good image of the text, the app is useless. But Google Lookout has solved this problem beautifully. I hope you'll add more languages to the app and provide the feature to share the image we take in the Read Document section with other apps.

Lazarillo Accessible GPS,"If I could give a negative star for this app, I would.  I am sighted and work with the visually impaired.  This app was very difficult to hear, it gave incorrect directions, and it directed me to a store that no longer existed! I will never suggest this app for anyone!!",06/22/22 21:02,3,1
Be My Eyes,"This app is a great example of the power of technology to actually improve the lives of anyone. This app focuses on blind or sight challenged folks in a clever way. I am not blind but it's just as important to me because it engaged me and makes me feel like part of a community every time I help out a blind person in need. Every interaction I've had on the app so far has been positive and I believe I was able to help the person on the other end. My only complaint is that I do not get enough notifications to help out but that's because there are already so many others ready to help which is a great thing. Next time you spend 20 minutes reading through a pointless Twitter storm rant or waste half a day on Facebook, remember that apps like this are the reason tech enthusiasts are so passionate about tech. I would love to see this concept expanded out to help anyone with needs.

BTW, my latest Be My Eyes call was some blind dude trying to pick out the best shirt to wear for an interview. I could help him by describing the shirts to him but then he started asking me for help on an entire matching outfit so I took the phone to my wife who helped me help him. Point is, we all need help from each other from time to time.",02/02/16 19:31,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"I’ve had this app for a year and have yet to successfully answer an incoming call. Either I accidentally swipe down when it’s supposed to be up, or left when it’s supposed to be right because there’s never an indication of what the right action should be. And since you only get a call about every 8 weeks it’s pretty hard to just remember.

Today I got a call and finally made it to a button to “answer”....pressed it frantically and nothing happened. Still couldn’t pick up a call. There’s a app message saying I need to enable my microphone and camera—- they clearly are for this app.

This is the first review of an app I’ve ever bothered to leave because I love the premise of this app and would love to be able to assist a blind person. However all this app has successfully done is ensure that I regularly hang up or decline a call from a blind person.",09/17/21 15:28,3,1

They never used it either. Consider advertising to those that need it. I know this may cost $$ & time but if you want this great concept to work, people have to use it.

OneStep Reader,"The ""braille"" support is not the best. voiceover only reads one word at a time per element, forcing the user to strictly rely on speech alone. The field of view reports do not work all the time. As a result, it is difficult to take photos of printed materials. There are better alternatives that do not cost a penny. Do not buy this app if you do not need to.",04/01/24 11:16,3,1
Be My Eyes,"New to the ""Be My Eyes"" app, so haven't received a call yet, but giving the 
concept five stars and then some! As a volunteer my only complaint, like 
many others listed, is that we cannot set our own call times. For instance, 
the app calls most people during the volunteer's daylight hours from 8 an 
to 9 pm...rather than the volunteer's ""awake and available"" hours. So for 
instance, if a blind user in the US needs assistance and in their own time 
zone it is 2:00 am in the morning...it would be considered the middle of 
the night for most volunteers in the US. So instead of a volunteer in the 
US getting a call, the call would be routed to volunteers on the other side 
of the world who would normally be awake in the ""daytime hours"". My 
problem, as a volunteer, is that I am a night person in the US. So calls 
may be routed to me during the day when I am sleeping and unavailable to 
respond. And calls from the other side of the world won't come to me when I 
am awake at night, because of the ""only call in day hours from 8 am to 9 
pm"" policy. So I may never get to respond to calls for help, but I am 
willing and able! I look forward to being of assistance. I can usually 
accept calls from 2:00 PM to 7:00 am Pacific Standard Time, and would love 
to be a voice in the night to help others! Just make the app able to allow 
users to set their own availability and then I'd give 10 stars if I could! 
Please add this option to the development of the app? The only other issue 
I can see a problem with is that a user is not supposed to put medical info 
or medication info out to a volunteer and volunteers are asked not to help 
with such. On the one hand....I can understand this, as that could be a 
serious liability for developers and volunteers to take on, if something 
were to go wrong. And there ARE actually bad people out there who could do 
harm to others in regards to medication taking. But on the other hand, if I 
were blind and taking medications I would certainly want to know that there 
was someone in the middle of the night that could help me with such....for 
instance, if I dropped my medications and needed help sorting them again, 
or if I needed help reading a prescription label for correct dosage or even 
to relabel it in Braille, or to read safety precautions on over the counter 
medications, to tell me if a medication was expired before taking it. So 
it's got it's good points and bad, there's no way around that really except 
to make the rule of not asking for help with such and not giving help on 
such, but that's unfortunate. Other than those two things.....what a GREAT 
service the inventer/developer has offered to world. Your generous heart is 
a rare kindness and I, for one, thank you for your foresight and altruism.

My husband is blind and has been having a blast going back through our thousands of vacation/holiday/family photos and really being able to ""see"" them for the first time. Thank you for making this app accessible to everyone and for opening this whole new world to us!",12/12/23 18:20,2,5

Be My Eyes,"The ""be my AI"" takes a picture and then describe what it sees. HOWEVER, it is a text description that is harder to see than what the visually impaired would be looking at. There is no option to have the text description read audible. Fix this and we'll go from one star to 5 stars.",08/09/24 13:59,3,1
Be My Eyes,"The app is perfect! But one of the blind person told me, the app doesn't allow him to make too many calls. As he is blind he needs help complete day",12/27/19 4:21,3,5
Be My Eyes,"Although give only just downloaded the app and haven’t yet had a call I can already tell this app is a game changer, I’m so glad somebody has come up with such an incredible idea to help others and it’s so easy to use! All I can say is more people need to know about this especially the blind or visually impaired as I would like to think it would be a massive help to them! Especially besucase there’s about a million volunteers and only 75,000 blind or visually impaired! I really hope this becomes worldwide and a common app to be used by EVERYBODY. It’s just brilliant:)",05/20/18 2:07,1,5
TapTapSee,"Great app and one that I will recommend to my students who are blind or visually impaired whom I teach iPad with accessibility features! To those with the questions on how to make it repeat, single finger flick back until you hear the button ""repeat"" then double tap (one finger for those new to VoiceOver) and it will repeat the description.

OneStep Reader,"I love this app. I have been waiting for this since this was a standalone portable scanner. this is finally with in my reach now as far as affordability.   It's the best $99 I've ever spent. sure, I had to budget a little bit. But that is quite alright considering that I can take it on the go and read things that I never could before.  At least not until I got home to put it under my scanner. this is going to make college handouts so much easier now. i'm telling every blind person I know that has an eye device about the app.",10/28/14 15:21,1,5

Be My Eyes,"Works great, had for about 2 months so far, only gotten 1 call... To be expected since you can see that the amount of volunteers outrank the blind by far...😋 For those complaining about getting calls at night, I did just read from another reviewer that you don't get calls from 9pm until 8am in your own time zone. Not sure if this is right or not... Also if you need to not get calls, you can just log out of the app until you are ready to take calls again.🙄 One thing I am curious about is as a fellow disabled person (not blind), how they keep people from deliberately giving answers that would be untrue or just be hurtful, as some people might find this funny...😠 Seems like that would be too easy for some to do.😐",09/08/18 9:01,1,5

You claimed to have left Russia, but can you please explain why Cyrillic text is not recognized when the phone's language is Ukrainian, but is recognized when the phone's language is Russian?

Be My Eyes,"I have been on this app as a volunteer for over 3 1/2 years. In that time I have taken anywhere from 5 to 8 calls. The fact that I do not get a lot opportunities to take calls means that there are millions out there like me who are so grateful to be able to assist the visually impaired.  Each time I take a call and assist, I’m reminded that I could do more in all aspects of life to help others.  So grateful for this app and volunteers who help others.",05/10/22 2:58,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I’ve used this app several times as a helper. I truly enjoy assisting those without vision, and it gives me a great sense of being a part of a global community. However, the ease of answering a call is something that they need to really work on. most of the time I find myself scrambling to try to figure out what to do next. I’m trying to unlock my phone, and I’m trying to figure out how to activate the app. The writers of the software need to come up with a vastly different approach to answering the call. several times when it’s called, I haven’t been able to get to it in time, and that’s with the phone in my hand. it could resemble how you answer a phone call, with a simple slider to activate your phone and take the call.",05/26/24 13:58,1;4,3

Be My Eyes,"I've taken several calls, ranging from someone asking what type of food item was in a gift basket to what color jewelry they had inherited from a large estate. It's always something new. Many calls take less than a minute but I actually like the longer calls. I have a vision issue myself, but want to stay on the volunteer side for as long as I can, knowing that I will eventually transition to having to use the services. Thank you for creating this. It's a wonderful service and a fun volunteer activity. I actually wish I would get cars more often. 😀",03/05/23 3:31,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,This app is very helpful to blind people. You can get help at any time of the day wherever you are. The volunteers are very helpful and patient. I recommend this service to all blind people. Thanks,05/07/24 14:42,1,5

Supersense - AI for Blind,"Supersense is a great all in one tool for accessing many features in one app. My phone screen is scattered with various blindness apps to help me do something or another. An app for reading money, an app for just quickly reading something I found, another app for quickly importing and reading a picture from the share sheet, ETC. this app is nice in the sense that it combines these all together limiting my array of apps I juggle around on a daily bases. 
Probably my favorite and most used feature is how the scanned text is displayed. Instead of your traditional screen where it just reads you the hole page of text, and you have to switch to line navigation or something similar if you want to read individual parts. They break the text into blocks, and it is super fluent to read the exact parts you need. Not only that, but you can copy these blocks of text easily to your clipboard via the roader.
Now, one thing I see people are concerned about is the price. It is subscription based. You can purchase a monthly, yearly, or a lifetime subscription. I don’t have much else to say on that, other than if you are worried about the price, you can download and try it out for free. Also, if you maybe don’t have the money to afford the app, at the bottom of the subscription signup page, you will find the following message.
“You may qualify for a reimbursement for your subscription from a state organization. Tap to request assistance and we will reach out to you with additional information.”
I am not exactly sure who all that would apply to, but it sounds like they are willing to work with you to get you any help you need. I think that is really great of them, and speaks very highly of them as a company.",10/16/20 17:35,1;2,5
Be My Eyes,This app is a great one. I had to wait a pretty long while before I got my first call and I have since answered two calls after then. The feeling I get after helping a visually impaired person is incomparable. Thanks for the app and keep working on making it better!,12/03/21 2:09,1,5
Be My Eyes,"I was amazed to find such an app and upon downloading was thrilled to see such a community thriving.  I decided to become a user.  While I have not used the app for my own sake I do know I will need it in the future.

Upon listening to the testimonies of users and volunteers helping people with various everyday tasks from picking out wardrobe, makeup, to computer issues and setting up household items like a TV or having a picture described in a museum.  Such stories were inspiring to me and I was moved to volunteer.  

This is where my rating finds itself at three stars.  I’ve become indifferent to the app altogether.  I want to use the app.  But at the moment I want to volunteer.  Had I known I only had one option upon creating an account I would have signed up to help my brothers and sisters in darkness shine a light into their world.  Because I am not allowed such freedom I have given the app this rating.  

I know as a user I will need assistance eventually as my vision gets worse.  Until such an alternative is given for volunteers and users I will leave my rating as such.",10/02/19 16:29,-1,3

Seeing AI,"My brother is blind and has been living independently for a few years now. Occasionally I'll head over and get a few questions -- maybe which flavor of a product is which. Maybe he received a few dollars back and he didn't know which was the 5 and which was the 1.

This app is able to help him with almost all of those questions, help make his life a little easier, and move him closer towards independence.

BlindSquare,"Fantastic!!!! its almost a luxury for a blind person to know the name and rough distance to the next intersection and some pois. I have yet to try it in an unfamiliar environment however, its performed well testing it randomly in surroundings i already know. Just put your phone in your pocket and walk round the block. I must stress, it cannot replace mobility aids,  nevertheless, Blindsquare has much potential.  Other features include, a look around button giving direction of road crossing or poi, shake to give current location and a very handy radius adjuster which gives more info if distance around you is increased.  I havnt discovered its full capability  as i have only had it a few days.  It gets  full marks for being so reasonably priced as usually anything that is This good and so vital for the blind costs the earth.",10/05/12 9:21,1;2,5
Seeing AI,"Very infrequently does an app come along which can have a real impact on improving the day-to-day lives of visually impaired people, many have tried and often don’t succeed.

Since it’s first launch in the UK Seeing AI has become a permanent fixture on my home screen for the main reason that it is helpful. As a visually impaired person, simple tasks such as reading product labels atop shelves In a large store can become both a complicated and embarrassing experience; however, with Seeing AI’s short text channel it becomes much easier to independently find what I’m looking for. Meanwhile, the document channel can be very useful if there is a printed page to read, I have found a relative consistency in the accuracy of the scanning and for standard printed documents it has proved to be very accurate on many occasions. Version 2 has also brought a number of enhancements such as multiple currency recognition and colour detection, which could be really useful for some people.

As of right now, Seeing AI isn’t ‘perfect’ as there are still some enhancements and needed improvements concerning factors especially regarding the ability to read different types of text, such as on a destination display board or picking out information with busy documents such as a restaurant Menu. However, Seeing AI has a great team of committed people behind them and have already made significant usability enhancements such as the use of 3D Touch on newer iPhone models to quickly reach a desired channel quickly.

Overall, for anyone who has a visual impairment Seeing AI is more than just a worthwhile download. It is a genuinely useful mobility aid, which in some cases is able to allow more tasks to be undertaken independently. Whilst there are still some improvements and enhancements which can be made to improve the experience, for the price of nothing there is no reason not to give Seeing AI a chance.",01/15/18 4:53,1;2,5

Be My Eyes,"Great idea. I look forward to the AI version being available. But why is there no dark mode for the UI. I'm photophobic and the abrasive bright white UI is unusable for me. It's seems unfathomable to me that an app for the visually impaired doesn't offer a dark mode UI option, or better yet, automatically detect the system wide UI choice of dark mode and adjust to match that.",12/04/23 10:32,1;3;4,4
